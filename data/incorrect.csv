PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled study. Patients >�18�years of age presenting to the outpatient urology clinic with uncomplicated radio-opaque stones located in the distal third of the ureter and of size ?�10�mm were included. Patients were randomly assigned to either a control group (n=26) and received standard of care management (daily oral hydration and diclofenac 75�mg IM on demand) or to the alfuzosin group (n=28) and received alfuzosin SR 5�mg twice daily in addition to standard of care management. Patients were followed weekly at office visits and twice weekly by telephone for 4�weeks or until stone expulsion. Assessments included stone passage rate and time, and patients were monitored for occurrence of adverse drug events, complications, number of pain episodes, analgesic consumption, and number of hospital revisits. Mann-Whitney, ?(2) , and Fisher exact test were used for data analysis. RESULTS: All 54 patients completed the study. Stone expulsion rate was higher in the alfuzosin arm (53.6%, 15/28) compared to the control arm (26.9%, 7/26, p=0.04). Median stone passage time was lower in the alfuzosin group than in the control group (9 vs 19�days, respectively, p=0.006). Ureteral sepsis, uncontrollable pain, and hospitalization readmissions were reported in the control group only. There were no differences between groups in number of pain episodes, pain scores, or analgesic consumption. Alfuzosin therapy was tolerable with only minor adverse effects (headache, dizziness, mild postural hypotension, and rhinitis). CONCLUSION: Alfuzosin is safe and effective in increasing stone expulsion rates and shortening stone passage times for uncomplicated distal ureteral stones.",1
13767,13767,25920094,"From non-A, non-B hepatitis to hepatitis C virus cure","The hepatitis C virus (HCV) was discovered in the late 1980s. Interferon (IFN)-alpha was proposed as an antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis C at about the same time. Successive improvements in IFN-alpha-based therapy (dose finding, pegylation, addition of ribavirin) increased the rates of sustained virologic response, i.e. the rates of curing HCV infection. These rates were further improved by adding the first available direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs to the combination of pegylated IFN-alpha and ribavirin. An IFN-free era finally started in 2014, yielding rates of sustained virologic response over 90% in patients treated for 8 to 24 weeks with all-oral regimens. Major challenges however remain in implementation of these new treatment strategies, not only in low- to middle-income countries, but also in high-income countries where the price of these therapies is still prohibitive. Elimination of HCV infection through treatment in certain areas is possible but raises major public health issues.",1
12801,12801,22782458,4-aminopyridine toxicity: a case report and review of the literature,"INTRODUCTION: 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) selectively blocks voltage-gated potassium channels, prolongs the action potential, increases calcium influx, and subsequently, enhances interneuronal and neuromuscular synaptic transmission. This medication has been studied and used in many disease processes hallmarked by poor neuronal transmission in both the central and peripheral nervous systems including: multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injuries (SCI), botulism, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. It has also been postulated as a potential treatment of verapamil toxicity and reversal agent for anesthesia-induced neuromuscular blockade. To date, there have been limited reports of either intentional or accidental 4-AP toxicity in humans. Both a case of a patient with 4-AP toxicity and review of the literature are discussed, highlighting commonalities observed in overdose. CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old man with progressive MS presented with diaphoresis, delirium, agitation, and choreathetoid movements after a presumed 4-AP overdose. 4-AP concentration at 6 h was 140 ng/mL. With aggressive benzodiazepine administration and intubation, he recovered uneventfully. DISCUSSION: The commonalities associated with 4-AP toxicity conforms to what is known about its mechanism of action combining cholinergic features including diaphoresis, altered mental status, and seizures with dopamine-related movement abnormalities including tremor, choreoathetosis, and dystonia. Management of patients poisoned by 4-AP centers around good supportive care with definitive airway management and controlling CNS hyperexcitability aggressively with gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist agents. Adjunctive use of dopamine antagonists for extrapyramidal effects after sedation is a treatment possibility. As 4-aminopyridine recently received Federal Drug Administration approval for the treatment of ambulation in patients with MS, physicians should be keenly aware of its presentation, mechanism of action, and management in overdose.",1
2245,2245,10383010,Low levels of dehydroascorbic acid in uraemic serum and the partial correction of dehydroascorbic acid deficiency by haemodialysis,"Vitamin C is currently considered a potent water-soluble antioxidant and it appeared reasonable to study the metabolic changes of vitamin C in uraemia and during haemodialysis. We measured the levels of ascorbic, dehydroascorbic and diketogulonic acids in sera of uraemic patients before and during haemodialysis, using the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine method. The results indicate that the levels of ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acids in uraemic sera are low in comparison with controls, but the levels of diketogulonic acid are higher than in healthy persons. The comparison of ratios between levels of these substances in uraemic sera and in normal sera indicate that the oxidation of ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic in uraemia proceeds much slower than in controls. We propose that uraemic patients are characterized by pronounced deficiency of dehydroascorbic acid. A marked decrease of ascorbic and diketogulonic acid plasma levels, and a pronounced increase of dehydroascorbic acid levels during haemodialysis was observed. Ratios between plasma levels of ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acids following haemodialysis are the same as in healthy persons. Uraemic patients are characterized by marked deficiency of dehydroascorbic acid and this deficiency can be partially corrected by haemodialysis. ",0
4108,4108,20512985,Multiple effects of silymarin on the hepatitis C virus lifecycle,"Silymarin, an extract from milk thistle (Silybum marianum), and its purified flavonolignans have been recently shown to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, both in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, we further characterized silymarin's antiviral actions. Silymarin had antiviral effects against hepatitis C virus cell culture (HCVcc) infection that included inhibition of virus entry, RNA and protein expression, and infectious virus production. Silymarin did not block HCVcc binding to cells but inhibited the entry of several viral pseudoparticles (pp), and fusion of HCVpp with liposomes. Silymarin but not silibinin inhibited genotype 2a NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity at concentrations 5 to 10 times higher than required for anti-HCVcc effects. Furthermore, silymarin had inefficient activity on the genotype 1b BK and four 1b RDRPs derived from HCV-infected patients. Moreover, silymarin did not inhibit HCV replication in five independent genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a replicon cell lines that did not produce infectious virus. Silymarin inhibited microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity, apolipoprotein B secretion, and infectious virion production into culture supernatants. Silymarin also blocked cell-to-cell spread of virus. CONCLUSION: Although inhibition of in vitro NS5B polymerase activity is demonstrable, the mechanisms of silymarin's antiviral action appear to include blocking of virus entry and transmission, possibly by targeting the host cell.",0
8111,8111,3994088,Multiple organ failure resulting from intravenous abuse of methylphenidate hydrochloride,"A 32-year-old woman who abused methylphenidate hydrochloride developed complications including hepatic, renal, pancreatic, pulmonary, and CNS toxicities. These were manifested by abnormal liver function enzymes, poor urine output, hypotension, tachypnea, tachycardia, abnormal blood gases, rising serum BUN and creatinine, and hyperactive deep-tendon reflexes. All were reversible with medication withdrawal and supportive therapy. Toxicities of this medication and their implications are discussed.",1
11099,11099,16887497,Effects of chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid on cholesterol absorption and metabolism in humans,"Quantitative and qualitative differences in intralumenal bile acids may affect cholesterol absorption and metabolism. To test this hypothesis, 2 cross-over outpatient studies were conducted in adults with apo-A IV 1/1 or apo-E 3/3 genotypes. Study 1 included 11 subjects 24 to 37 years of age, taking 15 mg/kg/day chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or no bile acid for 20 days while being fed a controlled diet. Study 2 included 9 adults 25 to 38 years of age, taking 15 mg/kg/day deoxycholic acid (DCA) or no bile acid, following the same experimental design and procedures as study 1. CDCA had no effect on plasma lipid concentrations, whereas DCA decreased (P < 0.05) plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and tended to decrease (P = 0.15) low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. CDCA treatment enriched (P < 0.0001) bile with CDCA and increased cholesterol concentration in micelles, whereas meal-stimulated bile acid concentrations were decreased. DCA treatment enriched (P < 0.0001) bile with DCA and tended to increase intralumenal cholesterol solubilized in micelles (P = 0.06). No changes were found in cholesterol absorption, free cholesterol fractional synthetic rate (FSR), or 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase and LDL receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels after CDCA treatment. DCA supplementation tended to decrease cholesterol absorption and reciprocally increase FSR and HMG CoA reductase and LDL receptor mRNA levels. Results of these 2 studies suggest that the solubilization of cholesterol in the intestinal micelles is not a rate-limiting step for its absorption.",1
2583,2583,12594313,Addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to standard chemotherapy for Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone,"BACKGROUND: Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone are closely related, highly malignant tumors of children, adolescents, and young adults. A new drug combination, ifosfamide and etoposide, was highly effective in patients with Ewing's sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone who had a relapse after standard therapy. We designed a study to test whether the addition of these drugs to a standard regimen would improve the survival of patients with newly diagnosed disease. METHODS: Patients 30 years old or younger with Ewing's sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone, or primitive sarcoma of bone were eligible. The patients were randomly assigned to receive 49 weeks of standard chemotherapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and dactinomycin or experimental therapy with these four drugs alternating with courses of ifosfamide and etoposide. RESULTS: A total of 518 patients met the eligibility requirements. Of 120 patients with metastatic disease, 62 were randomly assigned to the standard-therapy group and 58 to the experimental-therapy group. There was no significant difference in five-year event-free survival between the treatment groups (P=0.81). Among the 398 patients with nonmetastatic disease, the mean (+/-SE) five-year event-free survival among the 198 patients in the experimental-therapy group was 69+/-3 percent, as compared with 54+/-4 percent among the 200 patients in the standard-therapy group (P=0.005). Overall survival was also significantly better among patients in the experimental-therapy group (72+/-3.4 percent vs. 61+/-3.6 percent in the standard-therapy group, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to a standard regimen does not affect the outcome for patients with metastatic disease, but it significantly improves the outcome for patients with nonmetastatic Ewing's sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone, or primitive sarcoma of bone.",0
7552,7552,1974701,Brain tissue elasticity and CSF elastance,"In the analysis of the pressure-volume relationship of the intracranial system, the concept of brain elastance, sometimes called tissue elastance or CSF elastance, is often used. It is generally designated as Ecsf and is calculated as the slope of the pressure-volume curve of the system. Variations in Ecsf are related to, for example, changes in the buffering capacity of the system which, however, could be influenced by the cerebral vascular volume, compressibility of the meningeal membranes, and compressibility of the subpial brain tissue. Our interest is in isolating the effect of controlled changes in the intracranial system with changes in the subpial tissue only. Here we discuss the measurement of brain tissue elasticity and describe two experimental conditions in which simultaneous measurements showed distinct differences between the behaviour of the system CSF elastance and brain tissue elastic behaviour.",1
11089,11089,16854576,Hepatotoxicity potential of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) in rats,"""Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens L.) is an herbal drug used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). There has been a report that a preparation containing this herb has caused cholestatic hepatitis in one person and some indications exist that it may have the potential to produce liver toxicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of saw palmetto on rat liver function by measuring its effects on several enzymes and formation of malondialdehyde (MDA), a byproduct of lipid peroxidation. A significant increase in these parameters is considered an indication of liver toxicity. Thirty-six rats were divided into 6 groups of 6 animals each. They were treated for 2 or 4 weeks with a placebo or saw palmetto at doses of 9.14 or 22.86 mg/kg/body wt./day; that is, 2 x and 5 x the maximum recommended daily human dosages. After 2 or 4 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and blood was collected to prepare serum for enzyme assays, which were performed using commercially available kits. A portion of the liver was removed, and a homogenate prepared for the lipid peroxidation assay. Results showed no significant difference in animal body weight, enzyme activity, or MDA formation at either time or dosage level, as compared to controls. The data indicate that at the doses and time periods tested, saw palmetto did not produce any significant effect on the normal biological markers of liver toxicity.""",1
2910,2910,15241437,BCR-ABL transcripts are early predictors for hematological relapse in chronic myeloid leukemia after hematopoietic cell transplantation with reduced intensity conditioning,"Kinetics of BCR-ABL transcript elimination and its prognostic implications on relapse were analyzed in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after reduced intensity hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In all, 19 CML patients were conditioned with 2 Gy total-body irradiation in combination with (n=14) or without (n=3) fludarabine 3 x 30 mg/m(2) (Flu) or 4.5 Gy total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) with Flu and OKT3 3 x 5 mg (n=2) and were treated with cyclosporine (CSP) and mycophenolate mofetil after allogeneic HCT. BCR-ABL transcripts were analyzed by nested RT-PCR and Taqman((R)) RT-PCR on days +28, +56 and +84 after HCT and were evaluated for their association with relapse. Of the 19 patients, 14 achieved sustained remissions of which six had a negative RT-PCR 28 days after HCT. Five patients relapsed +41, +54, +57, +136 and +234 days after HCT. Predictors for relapse were advanced disease stage (P=0.02) and slow reduction of BCR-ABL transcripts at day 28 (P=0.006) and day 56 (P=0.047) post-transplant. We conclude that a complete clearance of BCR-ABL transcripts is achievable within 4 weeks from HCT even after minimal conditioning and that early kinetics of BCR-ABL transcripts significantly correlate with the probability of hematological relapse.

3744,3744,18946062,Toll-like receptor 4 polymorphisms and aspergillosis in stem-cell transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are essential components of the immune response to fungal pathogens. We examined the role of TLR polymorphisms in conferring a risk of invasive aspergillosis among recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplants. METHODS: We analyzed 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the toll-like receptor 2 gene (TLR2), the toll-like receptor 3 gene (TLR3), the toll-like receptor 4 gene (TLR4), and the toll-like receptor 9 gene (TLR9) in a cohort of 336 recipients of hematopoietic-cell transplants and their unrelated donors. The risk of invasive aspergillosis was assessed with the use of multivariate Cox regression analysis. The analysis was replicated in a validation study involving 103 case patients and 263 matched controls who received hematopoietic-cell transplants from related and unrelated donors. RESULTS: In the discovery study, two donor TLR4 haplotypes (S3 and S4) increased the risk of invasive aspergillosis (adjusted hazard ratio for S3, 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 4.25; P=0.02; adjusted hazard ratio for S4, 6.16; 95% CI, 1.97 to 19.26; P=0.002). The haplotype S4 was present in carriers of two SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (1063 A/G [D299G] and 1363 C/T [T399I]) that influence TLR4 function. In the validation study, donor haplotype S4 also increased the risk of invasive aspergillosis (adjusted odds ratio, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.15 to 5.41; P=0.02); the association was present in unrelated recipients of hematopoietic-cell transplants (odds ratio, 5.00; 95% CI, 1.04 to 24.01; P=0.04) but not in related recipients (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% CI, 0.93 to 5.68; P=0.07). In the discovery study, seropositivity for cytomegalovirus (CMV) in donors or recipients, donor positivity for S4, or both, as compared with negative results for CMV and S4, were associated with an increase in the 3-year probability of invasive aspergillosis (12% vs. 1%, P=0.02) and death that was not related to relapse (35% vs. 22%, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an association between the donor TLR4 haplotype S4 and the risk of invasive aspergillosis among recipients of hematopoietic-cell transplants from unrelated donors.",0
9156,9156,8604150,"Comparative studies on the toxicity of mercury, cadmium, and copper toward the isolated perfused rat liver","""The toxic effects of cadmium, mercury, and copper were compared over the over range 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mM using the isolated perfused rat liver preparation. All metals caused similar changes in various parameters used to describe general toxicity. Thus reductions in oxygen consumption, perfusion flow, and biliary secretion were found, while lactate dehydrogenase release into the perfusate, as well as liver weight, increased also in a dose-dependent fashion. Each metal caused similar magnitudes of changes and exerted similar potency. Measurement of other parameters indicating more specific injury revealed a number of differences. Although all metals reduced hepatic ATP concentration, mercury and cadmium were more potent than copper in this respect. Cadmium was the most potent at decreasing reduced glutathione levels. Mercury was most effective at increasing tissue calcium content, while copper was less so, and cadmium ineffective. Only copper significantly increased tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) content, while all metals increased its release into perfusate. Furthermore, whereas cadmium seemed the most potent metal in increasing MDA release, it was least efficacious, while copper was the most. Antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and Trolox C only reduced cadmium's influence on MDA in perfusate; however, they did not affect cadmium's ability to alter most other parameters of vitality. Albumin reversed the toxic effects of copper and mercury, but not cadmium. While metal-induced reductions in perfusion flow accounted for some of the toxic effects of the metals investigated, the results as a whole supported the suggestion that all metals exerted toxicity at the mitochondria, since ATP levels were reduced in a manner that could not be reproduced by perfusion flow reduction alone. Lipid peroxidation appears to play little role in determining toxicity induced by any of these metals. Furthermore, albumin may play an important physiological role in preventing hepatic injury that might otherwise be induced through acute metal intoxication.""",1
9205,9205,8764622,Isoniazid-related fatal hepatitis,"To describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of fatal hepatitis due to single-drug isoniazid preventive therapy for tuberculosis, we did a survey of cases from state health departments, published case reports, and reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1970 to 1992. Of 108 reported cases, some clinical information was available for 76. A medical review panel judged 39 of these deaths as probably due to isoniazid hepatitis and 23 deaths as possibly due to isoniazid hepatitis. Of the 62 probable and possible cases combined, 50 (81%) were female, 49 (79%) were non-Hispanic black or Hispanic, and 19 (31%) were younger than 35 years. The median duration of isoniazid preventive therapy before symptom onset was 16 weeks. Of the 60 cases with symptom information, 54 (90%) presented with jaundice. Of the 62 cases, 26 (42%) were monitored monthly in accordance with current recommendations, and 6 of the patients were younger than 35 years. We estimate that the rate of fatal isoniazid hepatitis among patients in the public sector was no greater than 4.2 per 100,000 persons beginning therapy and no greater than 7 per 100,000 persons completing therapy. Adherence to isoniazid preventive therapy guidelines apparently reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of fatal hepatitis. Careful patient selection, education, and monitoring are critical for minimizing that risk.",1

12154,12154,20574538,"A randomised trial to compare the safety, tolerability and efficacy of three drug combinations for intermittent preventive treatment in children","BACKGROUND: Results from trials of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) in infants and children have shown that IPT provides significant protection against clinical malaria. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) given alone or in combination with other drugs has been used for most IPT programmes. However, SP resistance is increasing in many parts of Africa. Thus, we have investigated whether SP plus AQ, SP plus piperaquine (PQ) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) plus PQ might be equally safe and effective when used for IPT in children in an area of seasonal transmission. METHODS: During the 2007 malaria transmission season, 1008 Gambian children were individually randomized to receive SP plus amodiaquine (AQ), SP plus piperaquine (PQ) or dihydroartemisinin (DHA) plus PQ at monthly intervals on three occasions during the peak malaria transmission season. To determine the risk of side effects following drug administration, participants in each treatment group were visited at home three days after the start of each round of drug administration and a side effects questionnaire completed. To help establish whether adverse events were drug related, the same questionnaire was administered to 286 age matched control children recruited from adjacent villages. Morbidity was monitored throughout the malaria transmission season and study children were seen at the end of the malaria transmission season. RESULTS: All three treatment regimens showed good safety profiles. No severe adverse event related to IPT was reported. The most frequent adverse events reported were coughing, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. Cough was present in 15.2%, 15.4% and 18.7% of study subjects who received SP plus AQ, DHA plus PQ or SP plus PQ respectively, compared to 19.2% in a control group. The incidence of malaria in the DHA plus PQ, SP plus AQ and SP plus PQ groups were 0.10 cases per child year (95% CI: 0.05, 0.22), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.022, 0.16) and 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.15) respectively. The incidence of malaria in the control group was 0.79 cases per child year (0.58, 1.08). CONCLUSION: All the three regimens of IPT in children were safe and highly efficacious TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00561899.",1
5741,5741,25692915,"Aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab for diabetic macular edema","BACKGROUND: The relative efficacy and safety of intravitreous aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab in the treatment of diabetic macular edema are unknown. METHODS: At 89 clinical sites, we randomly assigned 660 adults (mean age, 61�10 years) with diabetic macular edema involving the macular center to receive intravitreous aflibercept at a dose of 2.0 mg (224 participants), bevacizumab at a dose of 1.25 mg (218 participants), or ranibizumab at a dose of 0.3 mg (218 participants). The study drugs were administered as often as every 4 weeks, according to a protocol-specified algorithm. The primary outcome was the mean change in visual acuity at 1 year. RESULTS: From baseline to 1 year, the mean visual-acuity letter score (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better visual acuity; a score of 85 is approximately 20/20) improved by 13.3 with aflibercept, by 9.7 with bevacizumab, and by 11.2 with ranibizumab. Although the improvement was greater with aflibercept than with the other two drugs (P<0.001 for aflibercept vs. bevacizumab and P=0.03 for aflibercept vs. ranibizumab), it was not clinically meaningful, because the difference was driven by the eyes with worse visual acuity at baseline (P<0.001 for interaction). When the initial visual-acuity letter score was 78 to 69 (equivalent to approximately 20/32 to 20/40) (51% of participants), the mean improvement was 8.0 with aflibercept, 7.5 with bevacizumab, and 8.3 with ranibizumab (P>0.50 for each pairwise comparison). When the initial letter score was less than 69 (approximately 20/50 or worse), the mean improvement was 18.9 with aflibercept, 11.8 with bevacizumab, and 14.2 with ranibizumab (P<0.001 for aflibercept vs. bevacizumab, P=0.003 for aflibercept vs. ranibizumab, and P=0.21 for ranibizumab vs. bevacizumab). There were no significant differences among the study groups in the rates of serious adverse events (P=0.40), hospitalization (P=0.51), death (P=0.72), or major cardiovascular events (P=0.56). CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreous aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab improved vision in eyes with center-involved diabetic macular edema, but the relative effect depended on baseline visual acuity. When the initial visual-acuity loss was mild, there were no apparent differences, on average, among study groups. At worse levels of initial visual acuity, aflibercept was more effective at improving vision. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01627249.).",0

The question of the possible relationship between VPA hepatotoxicity and stimulation of GLA excretion remains to be answered.",1
2844,2844,15215481,Long-term survival of children with end-stage renal disease,"BACKGROUND: Although renal-replacement therapy for children with end-stage renal disease has been used for several decades, data on patients' long-term survival are sparse. METHODS: We examined the long-term survival of all children and adolescents who were under 20 years of age when renal-replacement therapy commenced (study period, April 1963 through March 2002), using data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry. Survival was analyzed with the use of Kaplan-Meier methods and age-standardized mortality rates. Risk factors for death were analyzed with the use of Cox regression analysis with time-dependent covariates. RESULTS: A total of 1634 children and adolescents were followed for a median of 9.7 years. The long-term survival rate among children requiring renal-replacement therapy was 79 percent at 10 years and 66 percent at 20 years. Mortality rates were 30 times as high as for children without end-stage renal disease. Risk factors for death were a young age at the time renal-replacement therapy was initiated (especially for children under 1 year of age, among whom the risk was four times as high as for children 15 to 19 years of age) and treatment with dialysis (which was associated with a risk more than four times as high as for renal transplantation). Overall, a trend toward improved survival was observed over the four decades of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvement in long-term survival, mortality rates among children requiring renal-replacement therapy remain substantially higher than those among children without end-stage renal disease. Increasing the proportion of children treated with renal transplantation rather than with dialysis can improve survival further.",0

To evaluate the efficacy and degree of irritation of 5-fluorouracil as a function of its application frequency. A total of 85 actinic keratoses in 53 patients were treated, initially with four applications per week for the first week. After this first week, if intolerable irritation arose, patients were instructed to reduce application frequency to two times per week for the rest of the treatment period. Treatment was completed for 95.4% of the lesions included, with healing of 88.6% of them. The mean time to healing was 7.4 weeks (with four applications weekly) and 10.2 weeks (with two applications). The healing rate was similar in the two groups. Significant correlations (p<0.001) were observed between application frequency and time to healing. Intermittent 5-fluorouracil treatment is effective without causing significant irritation, but time to healing increases with declining application frequency. ",0
9165,9165,8628357,Nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate compared with sclerotherapy for the prevention of variceal rebleeding,"""BACKGROUND: Patients who have bleeding from esophageal varices are at high risk for rebleeding and death. We compared the efficacy and safety of endoscopic sclerotherapy with the efficacy and safety of nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate for the prevention of variceal rebleeding. METHODS: Eighty-six hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and bleeding from esophageal varices diagnosed by endoscopy were randomly assigned to treatment with repeated sclerotherapy (43 patients) or nadolol plus isosorbide-5-mononitrate (43 patients). The primary outcomes were rebleeding, death, and complications. The hepatic venous pressure gradient was measured at base line and after three months. RESULTS: Base-line data were similar in the two groups, and the median follow-up was 18 months in both. Eleven patients in the medication group and 23 in the sclerotherapy group had rebleeding. The actuarial probability of remaining free of rebleeding was higher in the medication group for all episodes related to portal hypertension (P = 0.001) and variceal rebleeding (P = 0.002). Four patients in the medication group and nine in the sclerotherapy group died (P = 0.07 for the difference in the actuarial probability of survival). Seven patients in the medication group and 16 in the sclerotherapy group had treatment-related complications (P = 0.03). Thirty-one patients in the medication group underwent two hemodynamic studies; 1 of the 13 patients with more than a 20 percent decrease in the hepatic venous pressure gradient had rebleeding, as compared with 8 of the 18 with smaller decreases in the pressure gradient (P = 0.04) for the actuarial probability of rebleeding at two years). CONCLUSIONS: As compared with sclerotherapy, nadolol plus isosorbide mononitrate significantly decreased the risk of rebleeding from esophageal varices.""",1
2186,2186,10373070,Incidence and outcome of Clostridium difficile infection following autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation,"A retrospective evaluation of 200 consecutive recipients of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) was conducted to ascertain the incidence and outcome of infection with Clostridium difficile. The diagnosis was confirmed in 14 patients with diarrhea (15 episodes) at a median of 33 days after stem cell infusion. Five patients were neutropenic at the time of diagnosis. Every individual had adverse known risk factors such as recent or current use of antibiotic, corticosteroid and antiviral therapy, recent administration of myeloablative chemotherapy and numerous, prolonged periods of hospitalization. Diarrhea, frequently hemorrhagic, was the most common presenting feature along with fever, abdominal cramps and abdominal distention. Diagnosis was established by the stool-cytotoxin test. Response to standard treatment with oral vancomycin or metronidazole was prompt despite the presence of several adverse prognostic features in these patients. There was only one instance of relapse which was also treated successfully. Several transplant-related variables such as age, sex, underlying malignancy, myelo-ablative regimen, duration of neutropenia, and prophylactic use of oral ampicillin underwent statistical analysis but failed to be predictive of C. difficile infection in such a setting. Finally, C. difficile is not uncommon after autologous PBSCT and must be included in the differential diagnosis in any such patient with diarrhea. ",0
622,622,1984193,An epidemiologic study of abuse of analgesic drugs. Effects of phenacetin and salicylate on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity (1968 to 1987),"BACKGROUND: Phenacetin abuse is known to produce kidney disease; salicylate use is supposed to prevent cardiovascular disease. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal epidemiologic study to examine the effects of these drugs on cause-specific mortality and on cardiovascular morbidity. METHODS: In 1968 we evaluated a study group of 623 healthy women 30 to 49 years old who had evidence of a regular intake of phenacetin, as measured by urinary excretion of its metabolites, and a matched control group of 621 women. Salicylate excretion was also measured. All subjects were examined over a period of 20 years. RESULTS: Life-table analyses of mortality during the 20 years, with adjustment for the year of birth, cigarette smoking, and length of follow-up, revealed significant differences between the groups in overall mortality (study group vs. control group, 74 vs. 27 deaths; relative risk, 2.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.3), deaths due to urologic or renal disease (relative risk, 16.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.9 to 66.1), deaths due to cancer (relative risk, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.3), and deaths due to cardiovascular disease (relative risk, 2.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 5.5). The relative risk of cardiovascular disease (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke) was 1.8, and the 95 percent confidence interval 1.3 to 2.6. The odds ratio for the incidence of hypertension was 1.6, and the 95 percent confidence interval 1.2 to 2.1. The effects of phenacetin on morbidity and mortality, with adjustment for base-line salicylate excretion, were similar. In contrast, salicylate use had no effect on either mortality or morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Regular use of analgesic drugs containing phenacetin is associated with an increased risk of hypertension and mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular disease, as well as an increased risk of mortality due to cancer and urologic or renal disease. The use of salicylates carries no such risk.",0
9168,9168,8637535,The effects of supraphysiologic doses of testosterone on muscle size and strength in normal men,"""BACKGROUND: Athletes often take androgenic steroids in an attempt to increase their strength. The efficacy of these substances for this purpose is unsubstantiated, however. METHODS: We randomly assigned 43 normal men to one of four groups: placebo with no exercise; testosterone with no exercise; placebo plus exercise; and testosterone plus exercise. The men received injections of 600 mg of testosterone enanthate or placebo weekly for 10 weeks. The men in the exercise groups performed standardized weight-lifting exercises three times weekly. Before and after the treatment period, fat-free mass was determined by underwater weighing, muscle size was measured by magnetic resonance imaging, and the strength of the arms and legs was assessed by bench-press and squatting exercises, respectively. RESULTS: Among the men in the no-exercise groups, those given testosterone had greater increases than those given placebo in muscle size in their arms (mean [+/-SE] change in triceps area, 424 +/- 104 vs. -81 +/- 109 square millimeters; P < 0.05) and legs (change in quadriceps area, 607 +/- 123 vs. -131 +/- 111 square millimeters; P < 0.05) and greater increases in strength in the bench-press (9 +/- 4 vs. -1 +/- 1 kg, P < 0.05) and squatting exercises (16 +/- 4 vs. 3 +/- 1 kg, P < 0.05). The men assigned to testosterone and exercise had greater increases in fat-free mass (6.1 +/- 0.6 kg) and muscle size (triceps area, 501 +/- 104 square millimeters; quadriceps area, 1174 +/- 91 square millimeters) than those assigned to either no-exercise group, and greater increases in muscle strength (bench-press strength, 22 +/- 2 kg; squatting-exercise capacity, 38 +/- 4 kg) than either no-exercise group. Neither mood nor behavior was altered in any group. CONCLUSIONS: Supraphysiologic doses of testosterone, especially when combined with strength training, increase fat-free mass and muscle size and strength in normal men.""",1
8623,8623,6672506,The liver in fatal exertional heatstroke,"We describe the chronology of hepatic histopathologic alterations in 50 cases of fatal exertional heatstroke related to military training. Five patients who died in the field demonstrated the earliest alterations: fatty change (sometimes microvacuolar), amitotic hepatocellular regeneration, accumulation of hemosiderin, and congestion. In addition, the sinusoids contained polymorphonuclear leukocytes, immature erythroid and granulocytic cells, megakaryocytes, and lymphocytes. Fibrin was not evident. The other 45 patients, who survived up to 8 days following hospitalization, also demonstrated these findings. Microvacuolar fatty change was common in this group of patients, and degenerated hepatocytes resembled Councilman bodies. Coagulative degeneration and submassive necrosis were uncommon. Of those surviving over 12 h, more than half had bile stasis (sometimes ductal), frequently associated with acute cholangitis and ductular proliferation. Regeneration and pigmentary alterations have not been recognized as early hepatic findings in heatstroke, nor have intrasinusoidal bone marrow elements, ductal bile stasis, and acute cholangitis been described. Possible pathogenic factors, other than hyperthermia and sequellae of shock, include obesity, recent illnesses and immunizations, bacterial toxemia, hemolysis, and bone marrow injury.",1
8704,8704,6998337,Rifampin-isoniazid therapy of alcoholic and nonalcoholic tuberculous patients in a U.S. Public Health Service Cooperative Therapy Trial,"A history of alcoholism is often regarded as a relative contraindication to the use of isoniazid and rifampin in patients with tuberculosis. To test the validity of this assumption the outcome of 6 months of rifampin-isoniazid therapy was analyzed for the first 531 eligible patients enrolled in a U.S. Public Health Service Cooperative Trial of Short-Course Chemotherapy of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. In this study, data were available to classify a patient as an alcoholic in the following 2 ways: (1) patient's statement that he was a moderate, heavy, or excessive user of alcohol, or (2) patient's score of 6 or more on a Brief Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST). Based on their statements, 58% of the patients were classified as alcoholic, whereas only 17.9% were thus classified by their MAST scores. Although alcoholics had more abnormal concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) before and during therapy, there was no significant difference between the alcoholics and non-alcoholics in the incidence of adverse reactions, including hepatotoxic reactions, including hepatotoxic reactions, attributed to the drugs. We concluded that in the absence of clinically significant and persistent pretreatment abnormalities of hepatic function tests, rifampin and isoniazid are not contraindicated in patients categorized as alcoholic by our 2 commonly used methods.",1
13104,13104,23596311,HLA haplotype determines hapten or p-i T cell reactivity to flucloxacillin,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a main cause of drug withdrawal. A particularly interesting example is flucloxacillin (FLUX)-DILI, which is associated with the HLA-B*57:01 allele. At present, the mechanism of FLUX-DILI is not understood, but the HLA association suggests a role for activated T cells in the pathomechanism of liver damage. To understand the interaction among FLUX, HLA molecules, and T cells, we generated FLUX-reacting T cells from FLUX-naive HLA-B*57:01(+) and HLA-B*57:01(-) healthy donors and investigated the mechanism of T cell stimulation. We found that FLUX stimulates CD8(+) T cells in two distinct manners. On one hand, FLUX was stably presented on various HLA molecules, resistant to extensive washing and dependent on proteasomal processing, suggesting a hapten mechanism. On the other hand, in HLA-B*57:01(+) individuals, we observed a pharmacological interaction with immune receptors (p-i)-based T cell reactivity. FLUX was presented in a labile manner that was further characterized by independence of proteasomal processing and immediate T cell clone activation upon stimulation with FLUX in solution. This p-i-based T cell stimulation was restricted to the HLA-B*57:01 allele. We conclude that the presence of HLA-B*57:01 drives CD8(+) T cell responses to the penicillin-derivative FLUX toward nonhapten mechanism.",1
827,827,2816238,Displacement of warfarin from human serum proteins by halothane anaesthesia,"The in vitro effects of the halothane metabolite, trifluoroacetic acid, on the binding of warfarin to human serum proteins have been investigated. An increase in the percentage of free warfarin following incubation with different concentrations of trifluoroacetic acid (1 and 4 mmol/l) was observed. In addition, protein binding of warfarin was studied in serum from patients undergoing halothane anaesthesia (1-2.5%; 2.5 h). After 24 h from the end of the halothane anaesthesia, an increase in the percentage of free warfarin was also detected (0.92 +/- 0.06% at 24 h vs 0.60 +/- 0.02% before halothane administration; P less than 0.005). We conclude that halothane anaesthesia may temporarily potentiate the pharmacological effect of warfarin in the postoperative period following anaesthetic procedures. ",0
4868,4868,24312465,Low body weight in females is a risk factor for increased tenofovir exposure and drug-related adverse events,"Treatment with tenofovir sometimes leads to non-reversible kidney and/or bone diseases. Factors associated with these drug-related adverse events are poorly characterized. Our objective was to investigate such factors in patients treated long term with daily tenofovir. One-hundred Caucasian HIV-positive patients with basal creatinine clearance >80 mL/min treated with tenofovir for at least 6 months and with at least one assessment of tenofovir plasma trough concentrations were considered. Tenofovir-associated adverse events were defined as the appearance of pathological proteinuria, worsening of renal function or bone demineralization. By multivariate regression analysis, we found that serum creatinine (p = 0.003) and body weight (p = 0.002) were the factors independently associated with plasma tenofovir concentrations. In particular, women with body weight<50 kg had significantly higher plasma tenofovir concentrations than those weighting >50 Kg (160±93 vs.71±52 ng/mL, p<0.001). High tenofovir plasma trough concentrations and the age of the patients were independently associated with the development of drug-related kidney and bone toxicity. In this retrospective study we have shown that HIV-infected women with low body weight are at risk to be exposed to high tenofovir plasma trough concentrations, ultimately resulting in a significant hazard to develop long-term tenofovir complications.

10029,10029,11825325,Sirolimus: a comprehensive review,"Sirolimus (Rapamune), Wyeth-Ayerst, Madison, NJ) is a new, potent, immunosuppressant that is emerging as a foundation for long-term immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation. The drug acts during both co-stimulatory activation and cytokine-driven pathways via a unique mechanism: inhibition of a multifunctional serine-threonine kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Although there is no a priori reason to assume it, sirolimus displays a synergistic interaction to enhance the efficacy of cyclosporin A (CsA). In trials wherein the concentrations of CsA and sirolimus were tightly controlled, rates of acute rejection episodes were < 10%, despite markedly reduced exposures to each agent. In pivotal multi-centre blinded dose-controlled trials, the rates of acute rejection episodes within 12 months following administration of 2 or 5 mg/day sirolimus in combination with CsA and steroids were reduced to 19 and 14%, respectively. Since the inhibitory effect of sirolimus disables virtually all responses to cytokine mediators due to the widespread involvement of mTOR in multiple signalling pathways, the agent is likely also to retard proliferation of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, an important component of the immuno-obliterative processes associated with chronic rejection. The advantages of this unique therapeutic action combined with an intrinsic lack of nephrotoxicity are counterbalanced by myelosuppressive and hyperlipidaemic side effects. Ongoing studies are assessing whether the long-term benefits of sirolimus to permit reduction in exposure to or elimination of calcineurin inhibitors ameliorate the progression of chronic nephropathy, the condition that erodes long-term renal transplant survival.",1

An update based on clinical trial results,"""The safety of ciprofloxacin was established on a data base (compiled through the end of 1988) of 9,473 well-documented treatment courses world-wide. The daily dosages ranged between 200 and 2,000 mg orally. Thirty-eight percent of the patients received doses between 1 and 10 mg/kg body weight, 46 percent between 11 and 20 mg/kg, and the remaining 16 percent more than 20 mg/kg body weight daily. Ciprofloxacin was administered to 4,214 women (45 percent) and 5,252 men (55 percent). The duration of treatment ranged from less than two days to more than 90 days. A 600-mg daily dose of ciprofloxacin was used mostly in Japan (2,341 patients). The daily dose of 1,000 mg was administered chiefly in the United States and Europe (2,288 patients). The age of the patients ranged from less than one year to 99 years (mean, 50.6 years). More than 38 percent were older than 60 years. According to COSTART terminology, the following drug-related side effects were observed in the different organ systems: digestive, 4.9 percent; metabolic-nutritional, 4.4 percent; central nervous system, 1.5 percent, skin, 1.1 percent; hemic and lymphatic, 0.9 percent; urogenital, 0.8 percent; body as a whole, 0.5 percent; cardiovascular, 0.2 percent; special senses, 0.2 percent; musculoskeletal, 0.1 percent; and respiratory, 0.1 percent. Several patients had more than one reaction. The total incidence of side effects for the treated patients was 9.3 percent. The vast majority of adverse reactions were mild or moderate (94 percent). Serious side effects were reported for 55 patients (6 percent). Based on the 9,473 courses, the incidence of severe reactions was 0.6 percent. Ciprofloxacin treatment was discontinued due to side effects in 146 patients (1.5 percent), mostly due to gastrointestinal reactions (80 patients). The worldwide data from clinical trials with oral ciprofloxacin clearly demonstrate that the drug is relatively safe, and the side effects are usually mild or moderate in intensity and are reversible.""",1

The Phase II TRILOGY-1 and TRILOGY-2 studies investigated whether ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus the non-nucleotide NS5B inhibitor GS-9669 or the NS3/4A protease inhibitor vedroprevir could reduce treatment duration and/or eliminate the need for ribavirin in genotype-1 HCV-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis. METHODS: In TRILOGY-1, 100 cirrhotic patients were randomized (1:1:1) to 8 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus GS-9669 250 mg or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus GS-9669 500 mg. In TRILOGY-2, 46 previously treated cirrhotic patients were randomized (1:1) to 8 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus vedroprevir ? ribavirin. The primary end points were the proportion of patients with sustained virological response 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation (SVR12) and safety. RESULTS: In both studies, most patients were male (each 65%) and white (92-96%), infected with HCV genotype-1a (62-70%) and had IL28B non-CC genotypes (82-87%). In total, 37-39% of patients were Hispanic or Latino. SVR12 rates were similar across treatment arms in TRILOGY-1 (82-91%) and TRILOGY-2 (88-95%); no patient had on-treatment virological failure. Two serious adverse events (acute myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy) were reported in two patients participating in TRILOGY-1, both of whom had pre-existing cardiac conditions. Laboratory abnormalities were infrequent. CONCLUSIONS: All ledipasvir/sofosbuvir-based regimens were well-tolerated. To shorten therapy and eliminate ribavirin, use of a more potent third agent or a third agent with a different mechanism of action may be required.""",1
14138,14138,28121498,Bezlotoxumab for Prevention of Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection,"""BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients. Recurrences are common after antibiotic therapy. Actoxumab and bezlotoxumab are human monoclonal antibodies against C. difficile toxins A and B, respectively. METHODS: We conducted two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials, MODIFY I and MODIFY II, involving 2655 adults receiving oral standard-of-care antibiotics for primary or recurrent C. difficile infection. Participants received an infusion of bezlotoxumab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight), actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab (10 mg per kilogram each), or placebo; actoxumab alone (10 mg per kilogram) was given in MODIFY I but discontinued after a planned interim analysis. The primary end point was recurrent infection (new episode after initial clinical cure) within 12 weeks after infusion in the modified intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: In both trials, the rate of recurrent C. difficile infection was significantly lower with bezlotoxumab alone than with placebo (MODIFY I: 17% [67 of 386] vs. 28% [109 of 395]; adjusted difference, -10.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -15.9 to -4.3; P<0.001; MODIFY II: 16% [62 of 395] vs. 26% [97 of 378]; adjusted difference, -9.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -15.5 to -4.3; P<0.001) and was significantly lower with actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab than with placebo (MODIFY I: 16% [61 of 383] vs. 28% [109 of 395]; adjusted difference, -11.6 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.4 to -5.9; P<0.001; MODIFY II: 15% [58 of 390] vs. 26% [97 of 378]; adjusted difference, -10.7 percentage points; 95% CI, -16.4 to -5.1; P<0.001). In prespecified subgroup analyses (combined data set), rates of recurrent infection were lower in both groups that received bezlotoxumab than in the placebo group in subpopulations at high risk for recurrent infection or for an adverse outcome. The rates of initial clinical cure were 80% with bezlotoxumab alone, 73% with actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab, and 80% with placebo; the rates of sustained cure (initial clinical cure without recurrent infection in 12 weeks) were 64%, 58%, and 54%, respectively. The rates of adverse events were similar among these groups; the most common events were diarrhea and nausea. CONCLUSIONS: Among participants receiving antibiotic treatment for primary or recurrent C. difficile infection, bezlotoxumab was associated with a substantially lower rate of recurrent infection than placebo and had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. The addition of actoxumab did not improve efficacy. (Funded by Merck; MODIFY I and MODIFY II ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01241552 and NCT01513239 .).""",1

A range of electronic databases were searched: Web of Science (1945-2013), the Cochrane Library Database (Issue 12, 2013), PubMed (1966-2013), EMBASE (1980-2013), CINAHL (1982-2013) and the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1982-2013) without language restrictions. Meta-analysis was conducted using the STATA 12.0 software. The crude odds ratio (OR) with their 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Six clinical cohort studies with a total number of 5,189 patients undergoing PCI for coronary heart disease were included. Our meta-analysis revealed that the PON1 Q192R polymorphism was correlated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients receiving antiplatelet treatment after PCI (C allele vs. T allele: OR = 1.22, 95 % CI 1.04-1.43, P = 0.014; CT+CC vs. TT: OR = 1.38, 95 % CI 1.03-1.86, P = 0.029; CC vs. TT: OR = 1.45, 95 % CI 1.05-1.99, P = 0.024; respectively), especially among Asians. Furthermore, we found significantly positive correlations between the PON1 Q192R polymorphism and the incidence of stent thrombosis in patients receiving antiplatelet treatment after PCI (C allele vs. T allele: OR = 1.42, 95 % CI 1.08-1.87, P = 0.011; CT+CC vs. TT: OR = 1.93, 95 % CI 1.01-3.67, P = 0.046; CC vs. TT: OR = 2.18, 95 % CI 1.09-4.35, P = 0.027; respectively).

OBJECTIVE: We adopted the HLA-B *1502 genetic predisposition to carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) as a model to study the pathologic role of HLA in delayed-type drug hypersensitivity. METHODS: We in vitro expanded CBZ-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from patients with CBZ-induced SJS/TEN and analyzed the interaction between HLA-B and CBZ analogs based on CTL response, surface plasmon resonance, peptide-binding assay, site-directed mutagenesis, and computer modeling. RESULTS: The endogenous peptide-loaded HLA-B *1502 molecule presented CBZ to CTLs without the involvement of intracellular drug metabolism or antigen processing. The HLA-B *1502/peptide/beta(2)-microglobulin protein complex showed binding affinity toward chemicals sharing 5-carboxamide on the tricyclic ring, as with CBZ. However, modifications of the ring structure of CBZ altered HLA-B *1502 binding and CTL response. In addition to HLA-B *1502, other HLA-B75 family members could also present CBZ to activate CTLs, whereas members of the HLA-B62 and HLA-B72 families could not. Three residues (Asn63, Ile95, and Leu156) in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-B *1502 were involved in CBZ presentation and CTL activation. In particular, Asn63 shared by members of the B75 family was the key residue. Computer simulations revealed a preferred molecular conformation of the 5-carboxamide group of CBZ and the side chain of Arg62 on the B pocket of HLA-B *1502. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a direct interaction of HLA with drugs, provides a detailed molecular mechanism of HLA-associated drug hypersensitivity, and has clinical correlations for CBZ-related drug-induced SJS/TEN.""",1

Results from previous studies on ginsenosides' effects on human drug-metabolizing P450 enzymes are inconsistent and confusing. Herein, we first evaluated the inhibitory effects of fifteen ginsenosides and sapogenins on human CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes by using commercially available fluorescent probes. The structure-activity relationship of their effects on the P450s was also explored and a pharmacophore model was established for CYP3A4. Moreover, substrate-dependent phenomena were found in ginsenosides' effects on CYP3A4 when another fluorescent probe was used, and were further confirmed in tests with conventional drug probes and human liver microsomes.

Patients' efficacies were evaluated with Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Eisenberg antidepressant side effects scale (Asberg). Compared with the control group after 6 weeks of treatment, the cured-markedly effective rate was improved by 33.4% in the treatment group (P < 0.05). The HAMD was lower in the treatment group. The tendency of interaction of sleep disorder factor and anxiety/somatization factor was different between at the end of 1-week treatment and at the end of 6-week treatment in the treatment group (P < 0.05). The SDS score decreased at the end of 6-week treatment in the treatment group. The reduction rate was elevated by 19.23% (P < 0.05). By the end of 6-week treatment, the average score of Asberg decreased by 3.77 score in average in the treatment group, while it decreased by 0.07 score in average in the control group (P < 0.05). Acupuncture could effectively improve anti-depressive effects of SSRIs and reduce their adverse reactions. ",0
9563,9563,10217058,Criteria and recommendations for vitamin C intake,"Recommendations for vitamin C intake are under revision by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences. Since 1989 when the last recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of 60 mg was published, extensive biochemical, molecular, epidemiologic, and clinical data have become available. New recommendations can be based on the following 9 criteria: dietary availability, steady-state concentrations in plasma in relationship to dose, steady-state concentrations in tissues in relationship to dose, bioavailability, urine excretion, adverse effects, biochemical and molecular function in relationship to vitamin concentration, direct beneficial effects and epidemiologic observations in relationship to dose, and prevention of deficiency. We applied these criteria to the Food and Nutrition Board's new guidelines, the Dietary Reference Intakes, which include 4 reference values. The estimated average requirement (EAR) is the amount of nutrient estimated to meet the requirement of half the healthy individuals in a life-stage and gender group. Based on an EAR of 100 mg/d of vitamin C, the RDA is proposed to be 120 mg/d. If the EAR cannot be determined, an adequate intake (AI) amount is recommended instead of an RDA. The AI was estimated to be either 200 mg/d from 5 servings of fruits and vegetables or 100 mg/d of vitamin C to prevent deficiency with a margin of safety. The final classification, the tolerable upper intake level, is the highest daily level of nutrient intake that does not pose risk or adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the population. This amount is proposed to be less than 1 g of vitamin C daily. Physicians can tell patients that 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day may be beneficial in preventing cancer and providing sufficient vitamin C intake for healthy people, and that 1 g or more of vitamin C may have adverse consequences in some people.",1

1288,1288,6835306,The value of the autopsy in three medical eras,"To determine whether advances in diagnostic procedures have reduced the value of autopsies, we analyzed 100 randomly selected autopsies from each of the academic years 1960, 1970, and 1980 at one university teaching hospital. In all three eras about 10 per cent of the autopsies revealed a major diagnosis that, if known before death, might have led to a change in therapy and prolonged survival; another 12 per cent showed a clinically missed major diagnosis for which treatment would not have been changed. Among 1980 autopsies, renal disease and pulmonary embolus were less common causes of death than before, but systemic bacterial, viral, and fungal infections increased significantly and were missed clinically 24 per cent of the time. The introduction of radionuclide scans, ultrasound, and computerized tomography as diagnostic procedures did not reduce the use of conventional tests in patients who subsequently died and were studied by autopsy. Over-reliance on these new procedures occasionally contributed directly to missed major diagnoses. We conclude that advances in diagnostic technology have not reduced the value of the autopsy, and that a goal-directed autopsy remains a vital component in the assurance of good medical care.",0

The study compared the pathology and clinical conditions of 10 patients with PTU-associated small-vessel vasculitis and 18 patients with primary ANCA-associated small-vessel vasculitis. All patients showed manifestations of renal impairment. Compared with the primary ANCA-induced small-vessel vasculitis, patients with PTU-induced small-vessel vasculitis were mostly female (P<0.05) and deleloped the disease at a younger age (P<0.05). They had a higher positive rate of perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA; P<0.05), lower 24 h proteinuria content, lower serum creatinine (P<0.05) and milder histopathological lesions (P<0.05). A number of them had gross hematuria (P<0.05). They rarely used hormone and cytotoxic drugs (P<0.05) during treatment and had a better prognosis (P<0.05). In conclusion, PTU-induced small-vessel vasculitis has a milder pathology and clinical manifestations with a better prognosis. ",0
12565,12565,22045675,Circulating microRNAs as potential markers of human drug-induced liver injury,"""UNLABELLED: New biomarkers of liver injury are required in the clinic and in preclinical pharmaceutical evaluation. Previous studies demonstrate that two liver-enriched microRNAs (miR-122 and miR-192) are promising biomarkers of acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury (APAP-ALI) in mice. We have examined these molecules, for the first time, in humans with APAP poisoning. Serum miR-122 and miR-192 were substantially higher in APAP-ALI patients, compared to healthy controls (median DeltaDeltaCt [25th, 75th percentile]) (miR-122: 1,265 [491, 4,270] versus 12.1 [7.0, 26.9], P < 0.0001; miR-192: 6.9 [2.0, 29.2] versus 0.44 [0.30, 0.69], P < 0.0001). A heart-enriched miR-1 showed no difference between APAP-ALI patients and controls, whereas miR-218 (brain-enriched) was slightly higher in the APAP-ALI cohort (0.17 [0.07, 0.50] versus 0.07 [0.04, 0.12]; P = 0.01). In chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, miR-122 and -192 were modestly higher, compared to controls (miR-122: 32.0 [21.1, 40.9] versus 12.1 [7.0, 26.9], P = 0.006; miR-192: 1.2 [0.74, 1.9] versus 0.44 [0.30, 0.69], P = 0.005), but miR-122 and -192 were substantially higher in APAP-ALI patients than CKD patients (miR-122: P < 0.0001; miR-192: P < 0.0004). miR-122 correlated with peak ALT levels in the APAP-ALI cohort (Pearson R = 0.46, P = 0.0005), but not with prothrombin time. miR-122 was also raised alongside peak ALT levels in a group of patients with non-APAP ALI. Day 1 serum miR-122 levels were almost 2-fold higher in APAP-ALI patients who satisfied King's College Criteria (KCC), compared to those who did not satisfy KCC, although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.15). CONCLUSION: This work provides the first evidence for the potential use of miRNAs as biomarkers of human drug-induced liver injury.""",1
2712,2712,15056517,Multiple versus single antipsychotic agents for hospitalized psychiatric patients: case-control study of risks versus benefits,"Since use of multiple drugs to treat psychiatric patients is increasing, and research on this practice is rare, the authors carried out a retrospective case-control study of multiple versus single antipsychotic treatment in psychiatric inpatients. Inpatient treatment groups receiving either antipsychotic monotherapy or polytherapy were matched in terms of age, sex, diagnostic category, and admission clinical ratings (Global Assessment of Functioning [GAF] and Clinical Global Impression [CGI]), which yielded 70 subject pairs. They were compared in terms of total chlorpromazine-equivalent daily dose, changes in total daily dose, length of hospitalization, incidence of adverse effects, and changes in clinical ratings (CGI, GAF, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score) between admission and discharge. Initial doses were closely similar at admission for both treatment groups, but the median total final antipsychotic dose was 78% higher for those receiving antipsychotic polytherapy versus monotherapy. Also, median length of stay in the hospital was 55% (8.5 days) longer, and risk of adverse effects was 56% higher with polytherapy, whereas clinical improvement scores were similar (within 11%) for both treatments. Short-term treatment with multiple antipsychotics was associated with major increases in drug exposure, adverse events, and time in the hospital but with no apparent gain in clinical benefit. These findings require further testing in controlled prospective studies. ",0

Abnormal liver function tests and leukopenia were common laboratory findings. Epidemiologic and environmental investigations traced the source of arsenic exposure to a farm well with water containing 108 ppm arsenic. The soil adjacent to the well was also contaminated with arsenic, possibly from waste pesticide. Presumably, arsenic gained access to the well through obvious leaks in the well's casing. To our knowledge, this is only the second reported outbreak of fatal arsenic poisoning from contaminated drinking water and one of few instances where illness followed exposure to a toxic substance which was disposed of, or possibly disposed of, in an indiscriminate manner.""",1

11022,11022,16621917,Phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations of the mitochondrial polymerase gamma gene,"Mutations in the gene coding for the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma (POLG1) have recently been described in patients with diverse clinical presentations, revealing a complex relationship between genotype and phenotype in patients and their families. POLG1 was sequenced in patients from different European diagnostic and research centres to define the phenotypic spectrum and advance understanding of the recurrence risks. Mutations were identified in 38 cases, with the majority being sporadic compound heterozygotes. Eighty-nine DNA sequence changes were identified, including 2 predicted to alter a splice site, 1 predicted to cause a premature stop codon and 13 predicted to cause novel amino acid substitutions. The majority of children had a mutation in the linker region, often 1399G-->A (A467T), and a mutation affecting the polymerase domain. Others had mutations throughout the gene, and 11 had 3 or more substitutions. The clinical presentation ranged from the neonatal period to late adult life, with an overlapping phenotypic spectrum from severe encephalopathy and liver failure to late-onset external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, myopathy and isolated muscle pain or epilepsy. There was a strong gender bias in children, with evidence of an environmental interaction with sodium valproate. POLG1 mutations cause an overlapping clinical spectrum of disease with both dominant and recessive modes of inheritance. 1399G-->A (A467T) is common in children, but complete POLG1 sequencing is required to identify multiple mutations that can have complex implications for genetic counselling.",1

Plasma vitamin A concentrations were elevated. After all sources of vitamin A intake were stopped, the infants recovered without sequelae. The chicken liver homogenate contained 36,000 IU of vitamin A per 120 gm.

10700,10700,15389228,A randomized controlled trial of intravenous N-acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy after cardiac catheterization: lack of effect,"BACKGROUND: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after cardiac catheterization is common in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction. Studies of oral acetylcysteine to prevent CIN have produced conflicting results. Intravenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has logistic advantages in this setting. The objective of this study was to evaluate, in a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled fashion, whether intravenous NAC reduced CIN in the setting of cardiac catheterization in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency. METHODS: Patients with renal dysfunction undergoing cardiac catheterization were randomly assigned to intravenous NAC 500 mg immediately before the procedure or placebo. All patients received isotonic saline (200 mL) beforehand, followed by 1.5 mL/kg per hour for 6 hours, unless contraindicated. Exclusion criteria included acute renal failure, creatinine >400 micromol/L, concurrent dialysis, unstable clinical status, and prior NAC use. Baseline creatinine was obtained immediately before the procedure and repeated 2 to 8 days later. The primary end point was the occurrence of CIN defined as a reduction in creatinine clearance from baseline of >5 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault formula). RESULTS: The study was terminated early because of a determination of futility by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee after enrollment of 487 patients. The median baseline creatinine clearance was 44 mL/min (interquartile range, 33, 55). Median contrast received was 120 mL (interquartile range, 80, 175). Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. Altogether, 98 (22.0%) subjects had the primary end point: 23.3% in the NAC group and 20.7% in the placebo arm (P =.57). CONCLUSIONS: In this large, randomized trial, enrolling a high-risk group of patients with impaired renal function, intravenous NAC was ineffective in preventing CIN.",1
2667,2667,15047524,In vitro activities of piperacillin against beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae,"The in vitro activities of piperacillin (PIP) against beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin (AMP)-resistant (BLNAR) Haemophilus influenzae were compared with those of cefotaxime (CTX) and ceftriaxone (CRO), and the potency of PIP as therapy for meningitis caused by BLNAR is also discussed. PIP showed good activity (MIC at which 90% of strains are inhibited, 0.25 micro g/ml) against 69 BLNAR strains, and its activity was comparable to that of CRO and superior to that of CTX. No significant correlation was observed between the MICs of PIP and CTX or CRO or AMP, whereas a high correlation was observed between the MICs of CTX and CRO. In the killing study, PIP showed potent bactericidal activity compared with those of CTX and CRO. By microscopic examination, PIP caused the formation of a spindle and short filamentous cells with bulges and induced cell lysis in BLNAR strains, while treatment with CTX and CRO resulted in the formation of large, spherical cells without any obvious lysis. The affinity of Bocillin FL, a fluorescent penicillin used for determination of the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)s) for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), to PBPs 3a and 3b of BLNAR strains was drastically decreased compared with that to an AMP-susceptible strain (ATCC 33391). In the case of the BLNAR strains, the IC(50)s for PBPs 1a, 1b, and 2 were similar to those for the PBPs of ATCC 33391. Since the affinity of binding to PBPs 3a and 3b of the BLNAR strains decreased drastically, the second targets among the PBPs were PBP 2 for PIP, PBP1 (1a and 1b) for CTX and CRO. In conclusion, PIP showed excellent activities against BLNAR strains in a manner different from those of cephem antibiotics, suggesting that it could be a candidate therapeutic agent for the treatment of meningitis caused by BLNAR strains.

We tested whether 15-18 months treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (Omacor/Lovaza) (4 g/day) decreased liver fat and improved two histologically-validated liver fibrosis biomarker scores (primary outcomes). Patients with NAFLD were randomised in a double blind placebo-controlled trial [DHA+EPA(n=51), placebo(n=52)]. We quantified liver fat percentage (%) by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in three liver zones. We measured liver fibrosis using two validated scores. We tested adherence to the intervention (Omacor group) and contamination (with DHA and EPA) (placebo group) by measuring erythrocyte percentage DHA and EPA enrichment (gas chromatography). We undertook multivariable linear regression to test effects of: a) DHA+EPA treatment (ITT analyses) and b) erythrocyte DHA and EPA enrichment (secondary analysis). Median (IQR) baseline and end of study liver fat% were 21.7 (19.3) and 19.7 (18.0) (placebo), and 23.0 (36.2) and 16.3 (22.0), (DHA+EPA). In the fully adjusted regression model there was a trend towards improvement in liver fat% with DHA+EPA treatment (?=-3.64 (95%CI -8.0,0.8); p=0.1) but there was evidence of contamination in the placebo group and variable adherence to the intervention in the Omacor group. Further regression analysis showed that DHA enrichment was independently associated with a decrease in liver fat% (for each 1% enrichment, ?=-1.70 (95%CI -2.9,-0.5); p=0.007). No improvement in the fibrosis scores occurred. Conclusion. Erythrocyte DHA enrichment with DHA+EPA treatment is linearly associated with decreased liver fat%. Substantial decreases in liver fat% can be achieved with high percentage erythrocyte DHA enrichment in NAFLD. (Hepatology 2014;).""",1

This report presents an efficacy and safety study of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil hydrochloride in PDD. PDD patients (n = 550) were randomized to donepezil (5 or 10 mg) or placebo for 24 weeks. Coprimary end points were the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus caregiver input (CIBIC+; global function). Secondary end points measured executive function, attention, activities of daily living (ADLs), and behavioral symptoms. Safety and tolerability were assessed. ADAS-cog mean changes from baseline to week 24 (end point) were not significant for donepezil in the intent-to-treat population by the predefined statistical model (difference from placebo: -1.45, P = .050, for 5 mg; -1.45, P = .076, for 10 mg). Alternative ADAS-cog analysis, removing the treatment-by-country interaction term from the model, revealed significant, dose-dependent benefit with donepezil (difference from placebo: -2.08, P = .002, for 5 mg; -3.31, P < .001, for 10 mg). The 10-mg group, but not the 5-mg group, had significantly better CIBIC+ scores compared with placebo (3.7 vs 3.9, P = .113, for 5 mg; 3.6 vs 3.9, P = .040, for 10 mg). Secondary end points-Mini-Mental State Exam; Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System; Brief Test of Attention, representing cognitive functions particularly relevant to PDD-showed significant benefit for both donepezil doses (P ? .007). There were no significant differences in ADLs or behavior. Adverse events were more common with donepezil but mostly mild/moderate in severity. Although the study did not achieve its predefined primary end points, it presents evidence suggesting that donepezil can improve cognition, executive function, and global status in PDD.

In addition to drugs that release or mimic the effect of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), this could include drugs that inhibit: reuptake of norepinephrine or 5-hydroxytryptamine (also known as serotonin); bind to the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors or the cannabinoid receptors; and some peptides that reduce food intake. The sympathomimetic drugs phentermine, diethylpropion, benzphetamine, and phendimetrazine--so named because they mimic many effects of norepinephrine--are only approved in a few countries, and then only for short-term use. Sibutramine, a norepinephrine-5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitor, is approved for long-term use. Several new mechanisms for drug action are under investigation.

METHODS: In this prospective study, the entire ABCB4 gene coding sequence was analysed by DNA sequencing in 50 unrelated women with ICP defined by pruritus and raised serum alanine aminotransferase activity or bile acid concentration, with recovery after delivery. Genomic variants detected in patients with ICP were sought in 107 control pregnant women. Patients with ICP and controls were of Caucasian origin. RESULTS: Eight genomic variants were observed. One nonsense mutation (p.Arg144Stop) and two missense mutations (p.Ser320Phe and p.Thr775Met) were revealed each in one heterozygous patient. A third missense mutation (p.Arg590Gln) was detected in three heterozygous patients and in two homozygous patients also homozygous for a particular haplotype of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (c.175C>T, c.504T>C, c.711A>T).

Virtually all NSAIDs are capable of producing liver injury ranging from mild reversible elevation of liver enzymes to severe hepatic necrosis. METHODS: Mice were dosed intraperitoneally with mefenamic acid either one day at 100mg/kg and 200mg/kg, or 14 days dosing at 50mg/kg/day and 100mg/kg/day. Plasma was taken for alanine aminotransferase activity. Mice were sacrificed at the end of the study. Livers were removed and weighed. Liver samples were taken for histology. results: One-day doses of mefenamic acid revealed dose-dependent hepatocyte degeneration in the liver parenchyma. There were no significant changes in plasma alanine aminotransferase activity. Interestingly, 14-day daily doses induced hepatocellular necrosis, massive degeneration and inflammation. This was accompanied by a significant increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase activity and significant increase in the liver weight in the 100mg/kg/day mefenamic acid-dosed mice. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that mefenamic acid is capable of producing hepatotoxicity and care should be taken when prescribing or using this drug.",1
6745,6745,30761815,Current perspectives for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia,"With an annual incidence of 1-2 in a million, Ph*(+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disease that makes myeloid neoplastic cells breed out of control. This BCR-ABL(+) myeloproliferative disease makes up about 15%-20% of all leukemia cases in adults. CML is seen more in males than females, with a rate of three to two. However, it does not show differences in prevalence in terms of age. CML consists of three clinical phases. The first one is the chronic phase, defined by rising white blood cell levels and also by myeloid proliferation and bone marrow maturation. While this phase does not exhibit complications, in diagnosis, it comprises most of the patients. The second phase is the accelerated phase, which the disease progresses to if it is not treated or does not respond to treatment. This usually takes about 3 years. The third phase is the blastic phase. The chronic phase can still progress to the next two phases within the first 2 years, with a rate of 10%. In the following years, the possibility increases by 15%-20% each year. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are revolutionary drugs for the management of disease course in CML. The aim of this review is to assess current approaches to CML patients' follow-up and treatment with TKIs. A literature search on CML and TKIs was made in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus with particular focus on randomized clinical trials, recommendations, guidelines, and expert opinions. In managing CML, various treatment methods have been utilized for many decades. Prior to the development of TKIs, interferon alpha was the primary tool, which was then complemented by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT was successful in slowing the disease down in the long term and curing up to 50% of patients. Then the coming of the imatinib era opened up different treatment perspectives. For the patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib, second- and third-generation TKIs are successfully used in distinct CML disease states. The survival benefits of TKIs including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib for CML patients are outstanding. TKI-related adverse events could impact the clinical course, especially in long-term drug administrations. The current aim for CML disease management in the TKI era is to provide age- and sex-matched normal life duration to CML patients. ",0

In the patients treated with Merional-HG, we observed a higher occurrence of mature oocytes (78.3% versus 71.4%, p = 0.005) and a reduced quantity of gonadotrophins administered per cycle (2.556 ? 636 IU versus 2.969 ? 855 IU, p < 0.001). Fertilisation, cleavage, implantation rates and the number of positive ?-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG; pregnancy) tests and the clinical pregnancy rate were comparable in the two groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. In conclusion, the results of this study support the efficacy and safety of Merional-HG administered subcutaneously for assisted reproduction techniques. Efficiency of Merional-HG appears to be higher due to reduced quantity of drug used and the higher yield of mature oocytes retrieved.""",1

10515,10515,14625346,Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity,"""The analgesic acetaminophen causes a potentially fatal, hepatic centrilobular necrosis when taken in overdose. The initial phases of toxicity were described in Dr. Gillette's laboratory in the 1970s. These findings indicated that acetaminophen was metabolically activated by cytochrome P450 enzymes to a reactive metabolite that depleted glutathione (GSH) and covalently bound to protein. It was shown that repletion of GSH prevented the toxicity. This finding led to the development of the currently used antidote N-acetylcysteine. The reactive metabolite was subsequently identified to be N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Although covalent binding has been shown to be an excellent correlate of toxicity, a number of other events have been shown to occur and are likely important in the initiation and repair of toxicity. Recent data have shown that nitrated tyrosine residues as well as acetaminophen adducts occur in the necrotic cells following toxic doses of acetaminophen. Nitrotyrosine was postulated to be mediated by peroxynitrite, a reactive nitrogen species formed by the very rapid reaction of superoxide and nitric oxide (NO). Peroxynitrite is normally detoxified by GSH, which is depleted in acetaminophen toxicity. NO synthesis (serum nitrate plus nitrite) was dramatically increased following acetaminophen. In inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) knockout mice, acetaminophen did not increase NO synthesis or tyrosine nitration; however, histological evidence indicated no difference in toxicity. Acetaminophen did not cause hepatic lipid peroxidation in wild-type mice but did cause lipid peroxidation in iNOS knockout mice. These data suggest that NO may play a role in controlling lipid peroxidation and that reactive nitrogen/oxygen species may be important in toxicity. The source of the superoxide has not been identified, but our recent finding that NADPH oxidase knockout mice were equally sensitive to acetaminophen and had equal nitration of tyrosine suggests that the superoxide is not from the activation of Kupffer cells. It was postulated that NAPQI-mediated mitochondrial injury may be the source of the superoxide. In addition, the significance of cytokines and chemokines in the development of toxicity and repair processes has been demonstrated by several recent studies. IL-1beta is increased early in acetaminophen toxicity and may be important in iNOS induction. Other cytokines, such as IL-10, macrophage inhibitory protein-2 (MIP-2), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), appear to be involved in hepatocyte repair and the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines.""",1
9493,9493,9815810,Phase IB trial of chimeric antidisialoganglioside antibody plus interleukin 2 for melanoma patients,"We conducted a Phase IB trial of antidisialoganglioside chimeric 14. 18 (ch14.18) antibody and interleukin 2 (IL-2) to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD), immunological effects, antitumor effects, and toxicity of this treatment combination. Twenty-four melanoma patients received immunotherapy with ch14.18 antibody and a continuous infusion of Roche IL-2 (1.5 x 10(6) units/m2/day) given 4 days/week for 3 weeks. The ch14.18 antibody (dose level, 2-10 mg/m2/day) was scheduled to be given for 5 days, before, during, or following initial systemic IL-2 treatment. The ch14.18 MTD was 7.5 mg/m2/day, and 15 patients were treated with the ch14.18 MTD. Immunological effects included the induction of lymphokine-activated killer activity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, serum samples obtained following ch14.18 infusions were able to facilitate in vitro antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Antitumor activity included one complete response, one partial response, eight patients with stable disease, and one patient with >50% decrease of hepatic metastases in the face of recurrence of a s.c. lesion. Dose-limiting toxicities were a severe allergic reaction and weakness, pericardial effusion, and decreased performance status. Most patients treated at the MTD had abdominal, chest, or extremity pain requiring i.v. morphine. One patient had an objective peripheral neuropathy. This IL-2 and ch14.18 treatment combination induces immune activation in all patients and antitumor activity in some melanoma patients. We are attempting to enhance this treatment approach by addition of the anti-GD3 R24 antibody to this IL-2 and ch14.18 regimen.",1
6934,6934,31405828,Long-term macrolide antibiotics for the treatment of bronchiectasis in adults: an individual participant data meta-analysis,"Bronchiectasis guidelines recommend long-term macrolide treatment for patients with three or more exacerbations per year without Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Randomised controlled trials suggest that long-term macrolide treatment can prevent exacerbations in adult patients with bronchiectasis, but these individual studies have been too small to do meaningful subgroup analyses. We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to explore macrolide benefit in subpopulations, including those in which macrolide therapy is not currently recommended. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science from Jan 1, 2000, to Sept 30, 2018, to identify double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of macrolide antibiotics in adult patients with bronchiectasis. We applied no language restrictions. Randomised controlled trials were eligible if treatment was defined a priori as long term and had a primary or secondary outcome of bronchiectasis exacerbations. Studies in patients with cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis were excluded. The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was frequency of exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics. Secondary endpoints were time to first exacerbation, change in quality of life according to the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and change in FEV Of 234 identified studies, we included three randomised controlled trials, and IPD was obtained for 341 participants. Macrolide antibiotics reduced the frequency of exacerbations (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·49, 95% CI 0·36 to 0·66; p<0·0001). We also found that macrolide treatment improved the time to first exacerbation (adjusted hazard ratio 0·46, 0·34 to 0·61; p<0·0001) and was associated with improved quality of life measured by the SGRQ (mean improvement 2·93 points, 0·03 to 5·83; p=0·048). Macrolides were not associated with a significant improvement in FEV Long-term macrolide treatment significantly reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis, with similar benefits observed in all subgroups based on patient characteristics. This finding suggests that macrolides might be considered in patients in whom macrolides are not indicated according to the current guidelines, particularly if alternative approaches to reduce exacerbations have been unsuccessful. However, downsides of long-term macrolide treatment must also be taken into account. European Respiratory Society. ",0
4983,4983,24382002,Romosozumab in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density,"BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of osteoblast activity. The monoclonal antibody romosozumab binds to sclerostin and increases bone formation. METHODS: In a phase 2, multicenter, international, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, eight-group study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of romosozumab over a 12-month period in 419 postmenopausal women, 55 to 85 years of age, who had low bone mineral density (a T score of -2.0 or less at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck and -3.5 or more at each of the three sites). Participants were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous romosozumab monthly (at a dose of 70 mg, 140 mg, or 210 mg) or every 3 months (140 mg or 210 mg), subcutaneous placebo, or an open-label active comparator--oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or subcutaneous teriparatide (20 ?g daily). The primary end point was the percentage change from baseline in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine at 12 months. Secondary end points included percentage changes in bone mineral density at other sites and in markers of bone turnover. RESULTS: All dose levels of romosozumab were associated with significant increases in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, including an increase of 11.3% with the 210-mg monthly dose, as compared with a decrease of 0.1% with placebo and increases of 4.1% with alendronate and 7.1% with teriparatide. Romosozumab was also associated with large increases in bone mineral density at the total hip and femoral neck, as well as transitory increases in bone-formation markers and sustained decreases in a bone-resorption marker. Except for mild, generally nonrecurring injection-site reactions with romosozumab, adverse events were similar among groups. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women with low bone mass, romosozumab was associated with increased bone mineral density and bone formation and with decreased bone resorption.

In addition there was severe cholestatic hepatitis in the absence of clinical evidence of sepsis, biliary obstruction or recurrent metastases. The rash resolved on steroid therapy but the patient eventually died from both renal and liver failure. Acute tubular necrosis with a background of chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis was also found at autopsy. Although in the presence of multiple drug therapy the causative agent cannot be identified with absolute certainty, the association of these severe idiosyncratic hepatic and dermatological reactions with haemolytic anaemia strongly suggests mefenamic acid as the most likely culprit.",1

Ninety-eight patients with clinicopathologically proven chronic hepatitis B were randomly allocated to 3 groups: 1) group A received a 26-week course of Talpha with a 1.6-mg subcutaneous injection two times a week (T6 group); 2) group B received the same regimen as group A, but Talpha therapy extended for 52 weeks (T12 group); and 3) group C served as a control group and was followed up for 18 months without specific treatment (T0 group). The three groups were comparable in clinicohistological features at entry. The complete virological response rate (clearance of serum hepatitis B virus [HBV] DNA and hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]) was higher in group A (40.6%) and group B (26.5%) than in group C (9.4%) (group A vs. group C: P=.004; group B vs. group C: P=.068) when assessed 18 months after entry, although complete response rates among these three groups were similar when first assessed at the end of therapy. There was a trend for complete virological response to increase or accumulate gradually after the end of Talpha therapy. None of the responders lost hepatitis B surface antigen. Blinded histological assessment showed a significant improvement in treated patients, particularly in lobular necroinflammation and scores excluding fibrosis. No significant side effects were observed. These results suggest that a 26-week course of Talpha therapy is effective and safe in patients with chronic hepatitis B.",0
99,99,581782,Comparison of the immediate effects of five beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs with different ancillary properties in angina pectoris,"We compared the immediate effects of five beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agents in 16 patients with stable angina pectoris. Acute dose-response studies showed that all five drugs improved exercise tolerance and reduced ST-segment depression, heart rate and blood pressure by a similar degree in comparison with a placebo (P less than 0.01). Near maximum improvement in exercise tolerance occurred when the acute cumulative oral dose had reached 160 mg for propranolol and oxprenolol, 200 mg for metoprolol and tolamolol and 400 mg for practolol. When these drugs were administered as a single doses, increase in walking time before the development of angina and reduction in ST-segment depression, heart rate and systolic blood pressure all occurred within one hour and persisted for eight hours--effects markedly different from the response to a placebo (P less than 0.01). These data show that non-cardioselective agents (propranolol and oxprenolol), cardioselective agents (practolol, metoprolol and tolamolol), as well as drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (oxprenolol and practolol), were equally effective in the treatment of angina pectoris.",0

11903,11903,19669383,A case of lamivudine-sensitive de novo acute hepatitis B induced by rituximab with the CHOP regimen for diffuse large B cell lymphoma,"A case of de novo acute hepatitis B that showed symptoms of general malaise and anorexia during rituximab therapy with the CHOP regimen for diffuse large B cell lymphoma is reported. Lamivudine was strikingly effective, showing a rapid recovery from liver damage with jaundice. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in serum became and stayed undetectable even after the withdrawal of lamivudine, although HBsAg remained positive over 42 months from the onset. Liver biopsy showed a picture suggestive of acute viral hepatitis with multinucleated giant hepatocytes and CD38-positive plasma cell infiltration into liver parenchyma. Immunohistochemically, CD3-positive T-cells were predominant cells that infiltrated in liver parenchyma, whereas CD20-positive B cells were essentially null. Hence, it is suggested from these findings that B lymphocytes might be crucial for the continuous latency in HBV infection and may give rise to de novo acute hepatitis B if totally deleted. Moreover, the CHOP regimen might have some additive effects with the repeated on-off use of corticosteroids to the onset of the disease. In addition, significance of plasma cell infiltration in this setting is discussed.",1

8092,8092,3944744,Hepatomegaly following short-term high-dose steroid therapy,"Children treated with large doses of corticosteroids were found to develop hepatomegaly within a few days. No relationship could be established between the condition for which steroids were given and the liver enlargement. Liver biopsy was thought to be indicated, and thus was performed in three children because of diagnostic uncertainty. The light and electron microscopic examinations revealed normal liver architecture, without edema, sinusoid engorgement, or inflammatory changes. The hepatocytes were distended by increased amounts of glycogen. In a pattern reminiscent of some glycogen storage diseases, mitochondria and other cytosol components were displaced toward the cell membrane or around the nucleus, which occasionally contained glycogen. Moderate sinusoidal compression, interhepatocytic free glycogen particles, and mild increase in lipid droplets were also found. It is concluded that the hepatomegaly noted in patients given short-term, high-dosage steroid therapy is due to excessive glycogen accumulation within parenchymal cells. This finding is in accordance with observations in animals, as well as with biochemical studies demonstrating hepatocytic glycogen deposition after steroid therapy. Being benign and reversible, early hepatomegaly following administration of high-dose corticosteroids should not influence the initial therapeutic plan required by the basic disease.",1

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 329 medical charts of patients who were treated with Regimen I and discharged after cure between March 2000 and April 2006 was carried out at the Tuberculosis Outpatient Clinic, Department of Pulmonology of the Santa Casa de Miseric?rdia de S?o Paulo Hospital in the city of S?o Paulo, Brazil. Adverse effects and the timing of their appearance, as well as subsequent modifications in the treatment regimen, were investigated. RESULTS: We included 297 patients, 146 (49.1%) of whom presented one or more adverse effects related to antituberculosis medications. The frequency of minor side effects was 41.1%, and that of major side effects was 12.8%. The most common reactions were those involving the gastrointestinal tract (40.3%) and the skin (22.1%). Adverse effects were more common in the first and second months of treatment (58.4%). Modification of the treatment regimen was necessary in 11 cases (3.7% of the total sample). Drug-induced hepatitis was the adverse effect that demanded the most regimen changes.

METHODS: We randomly assigned 7213 patients with an acute coronary syndrome for whom PCI was anticipated to receive either bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin. Patients in the bivalirudin group were subsequently randomly assigned to receive or not to receive a post-PCI bivalirudin infusion. Primary outcomes for the comparison between bivalirudin and heparin were the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) and net adverse clinical events (a composite of major bleeding or a major adverse cardiovascular event). The primary outcome for the comparison of a post-PCI bivalirudin infusion with no post-PCI infusion was a composite of urgent target-vessel revascularization, definite stent thrombosis, or net adverse clinical events. RESULTS: The rate of major adverse cardiovascular events was not significantly lower with bivalirudin than with heparin (10.3% and 10.9%, respectively; relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.09; P=0.44), nor was the rate of net adverse clinical events (11.2% and 12.4%, respectively; relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.03; P=0.12).

In an attempt to develop a simpler and faster tool for evaluating the adequacy of zinc therapy, a technique that measures the uptake into blood of a small oral dose of 64copper was studied in conjunction with copper balance. The mean peak 64copper uptake into blood of nine Wilson's disease patients on D-penicillamine, trien, or no medication was 6.04 +/- 2.74%, comparable with normal controls. Seven patients on zinc therapy had a markedly and significantly reduced mean uptake of 0.79 +/- 1.05% after treatment. The data demonstrate that the prevention of copper uptake into blood in Wilson's disease patients by zinc therapy can be evaluated by 64copper uptake and that peak uptakes of less than 1% occur in patients with neutral or negative copper balance.",1

The two-page survey was completed by 57% of a random sample of 2,500 members of the American Gastroenterological Association and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Analysis was limited to the 1,249 responses from physicians who spent at least 1 day per week in patient care. These physicians frequently managed patients with HCV, and nearly three quarters treated patients with interferon. To prevent transmission, the large majority of physicians recommended measures to avoid blood exposures, were uncertain or disagreed about the importance of sexual contact, and did not caution patients about casual contact. More than 70% of physicians told their patients to stop or minimize alcohol consumption. In the management of a patient with antibody to HCV but normal serum aminotransferase activities, 87% of physicians would have ordered a supplemental test, and if HCV were confirmed, 46% would have obtained a liver biopsy, but only 15% would have treated the patient with interferon. For a patient with chronic HCV infection and elevated serum aminotransferase activities, more than 90% of physicians would have obtained a liver biopsy and approximately 60% would have treated with interferon. Physicians who are most familiar with the management of patients with HCV generally agreed with the recommendations of the Consensus Development Conference Panel regarding prevention of transmission, minimizing alcohol consumption, and managing patients with typical presentations.

2388,2388,11172139,Transplantation of bone marrow as compared with peripheral-blood cells from HLA-identical relatives in patients with hematologic cancers,"BACKGROUND: In recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplants, peripheral-blood cells mobilized with the use of filgrastim (recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) engraft more rapidly than bone marrow. However, the relative effects of these techniques on the rates of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, overall survival, and disease-free survival have not been determined in randomized studies. METHODS: Between March 1996 and July 1999, 172 patients (12 to 55 years of age) with hematologic cancer were randomly assigned to receive either bone marrow or filgrastim-mobilized peripheral-blood cells from HLA-identical relatives for hematopoietic rescue after the treatment of hematologic cancer with high doses of chemotherapy, with or without radiation. RESULTS: The recovery of both neutrophils and platelets was faster with peripheral-blood cells than with marrow (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The cumulative incidence of grade II, III, or IV acute graft-versus-host disease at 100 days was 64 percent with peripheral-blood cells and 57 percent with marrow (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.81; P=0.35). The cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 46 percent with peripheral-blood cells and 35 percent with marrow (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 1.90; P=0.54). The estimated overall probability of survival at two years was 66 percent with peripheral-blood cells and 54 percent with marrow (hazard ratio for death, 0.62; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.38 to 1.02; P=0.06).

In all, 522 patients age 15 to 55 years old and presenting with at least 1 conventional high-risk factor were candidates for SCT in first complete remission. Among these, 282 (54%) received a transplant in first complete remission. At 3 years, posttransplant cumulative incidences of relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and relapse-free survival (RFS) were estimated at 19.5%, 15.5%, and 64.7%, respectively. Time-dependent analysis did not reveal a significant difference in RFS between SCT and no-SCT cohorts. However, SCT was associated with longer RFS in patients with postinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) ≥10(-3) (hazard ratio, 0.40) but not in good MRD responders. In B-cell precursor ALL, SCT also benefitted patients with focal IKZF1 gene deletion (hazard ratio, 0.42).

In open filed, the IFNalpha treated rats showed anxiety behaviour compared to the rats from the other groups. There was no significant difference in home cage emergence test, Morris water maze and object recognition test. There is no significant difference in plasma corticosterone between groups. The pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL1beta and IFNgamma), were significantly higher whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL10 was lower in the stimulated whole blood culture of IFNalpha treated rats. In the brain, both pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1beta and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 were higher in hypothalamus of the IFNalpha treated rats; by contrast the concentration of IL10 was lowest in hippocampus region of this group compared to the other groups. The paroxetine pretreated rats did not show these cytokine changes following IFNalpha treatment. Thus it appears that paroxetine pretreatment prevents the pro-inflammatory changes in blood and brain following IFNalpha treatment in turn prevents the anxiety behaviour. ",0
1996,1996,9791144,Effect of bradykinin-receptor blockade on the response to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor in normotensive and hypertensive subjects,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors not only decrease the production of angiotensin II but also decrease the degradation of bradykinin. In this study, a specific bradykinin-receptor antagonist, icatibant acetate (HOE 140), was used to determine the contribution of bradykinin to the short-term effects of ACE inhibition on blood pressure and plasma renin activity in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects. METHODS: We compared the hemodynamic, renal, and endocrine effects of captopril alone (25 mg), captopril plus icatibant (100 microg per kilogram of body weight), the angiotensin II subtype 1-receptor antagonist losartan (75 mg), and placebo in 20 subjects with normal blood pressure and 7 subjects with hypertension. The subjects were studied while they were salt depleted (i.e., in balance on a diet in which they were allowed 10 mmol of sodium per day). The drugs were administered on four separate study days in a single-blind, randomized fashion. RESULTS: The coadministration of icatibant significantly attenuated the hypotensive effect of captopril (maximal decrease in mean arterial pressure for all subjects combined, 10.5+/-1.0 mm Hg, as compared with 14.0+/-1.0 mm Hg for captopril alone; P=0.001), in such a way that the decrease in blood pressure after the administration of captopril plus icatibant was similar to that after the administration of losartan (maximal decrease in mean arterial pressure, 11.0+/-1.7 mm Hg). Icatibant did not alter the renal hemodynamic response to captopril, but it significantly altered the change in plasma renin activity in response to ACE inhibition (-0.4+/-0.4 ng of angiotensin I per milliliter per hour, as compared with 2.0+/-0.7 ng per milliliter per hour for captopril alone; P=0.007). The magnitude of these effects was similar in both the normotensive and the hypertensive subjects, as well as in both the black subjects and the white subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that bradykinin contributes to the short-term effects of ACE inhibition on blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive persons and suggest that bradykinin also contributes to the short-term effects of ACE inhibition on the renin-angiotensin system.",0

We here present an update of our single-center experience with fludarabine-melphalan as a preparative regimen. Fifty-eight patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent RIC and allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a matched related donor (MRD; n=25) or a matched unrelated donor (MUD; n=33). Forty-eight (83%) had undergone prior autologous stem cell transplantation. Disease status at transplant was refractory relapse (n=28) or sensitive relapse (n=30). Cumulative day 100 and 2-year transplant-related mortality rates were 7% and 15%, respectively (day 100 transplant-related mortality MRD vs. MUD 8% vs. 6%, p=ns; 2-year MRD vs. MUD 13% vs. 16%, p=ns). The cumulative incidence of acute (grade II-IV) graft-versus-host disease in the first 100 days was 28% (MRD vs. MUD 12% vs. 39%, p=0.04). The cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease at any time was 73% (MRD vs. MUD 57% vs. 85%, p=0.006). Projected 2-year overall and progression-free survival rates are 64% (49-76%) and 32% (20-45%), with 2-year disease progression/relapse at 55% (43-70%). There was no statistically significant differences in overall survival progression-free survival, and disease progression/relapse between MRD and MUD transplants. There was a trend for the response status pretransplant to have a favorable impact on progression-free survival (p=0.07) and disease progression/relapse (p=0.049), but not on overall survival (p=0.4) Fludarabine-melphalan as a preparative regimen for reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation in progression-free survival Hodgkin's lymphoma is associated with a significant reduction in transplant-related mortality, with comparable results in MRD and MUD allografts. Optimizing pretransplant response status may improve patients' outcome. ",0

CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old healthy woman from Iraq developed acute cholestatic hepatitis 3 weeks following repair of the right rotator cuff under general anesthesia. There was no evidence for viral, autoimmune, or metabolic causes of hepatitis. No other medications were involved except for dipyrone for analgesia. The alanine aminotransferase was elevated to a peak concentration of 1533 U/L and the serum bilirubin reached a peak of 17.0 mg/dL. There was slow improvement over 4 months. Accidental reexposure by the patient to dipyrone was uneventful. DISCUSSION: The clinical and histologic picture of this case resembles halothane hepatitis, which has a significant mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Isoflurane, a common anesthetic agent, can cause severe cholestatic hepatitis.",1

Forty-five patients tolerated at least 25 mg per day of bromocriptine (the """"adequately treated"""" group) in addition to Sinemet and had significantly decreased rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia, gait disturbance, and total score, but increased involuntary movements. Twenty-five of these 45 patients improved by at least one stage. Among the 45 patients, 27 had """"on-off"""" effects, and in 19 the """"on-off"""" effects decreased on bromocriptine. The mean dose of bromocriptine in adequately treated patients las 47 mg, permitting a 10 percent reduction in the dose of levodopa. Twelve adequately treated patients received bromocriptine for at least 1 year, and 8 continued for longer than this. Bromocriptine was discontinued in 29 of 66 patients because of adverse effects, including mental changes (14 patients) and involuntary movements (9 patients). All adverse effects were reversible. Despite adverse effects, expense, and scarcity, bromocriptine, when added to levodopa, is useful in patients with advanced disease who no longer respond satisfactorily to levodopa, and for whom no other treatment is available.""",1

Ten men with gonadotrophin deficiency requiring induction of spermatogenesis and fertility were treated with HCG for 3-6 months followed by the s.c. self-administration of injections of r-hFSH in combination with HCG for 18 months. Among the eight men who commenced r-hFSH treatment, seven demonstrated sperm output at a median of 6 months and five achieved the target sperm output of 1. 5x10(6) per ml at a median of 9 months of FSH treatment. Mean testicular volume increased by 4.2 ml during FSH treatment. Three men produced pregnancies in their partners, two of which resulted in the birth of healthy babies and a third patient's partner had a miscarriage. We conclude that r-hFSH is well tolerated and effective in inducing testis growth, spermatogenesis and fertility in gonadotrophin-deficient men. The efficacy of r-hFSH seems comparable with urinary FSH at restoring normal fertility in gonadotrophin-deficient men.",1

At present topical ocular chloramphenicol is widely used in the UK for the treatment of conjunctivitis, whereas it is very rarely prescribed for this indication in the U.S. Individual policies vary around the rest of the world. The evidence for and against any association between topical and ocular chloramphenicol and an increased risk of aplastic anaemia is reviewed, and the reasons behind the current prescribing policies are clarified. The discussion generated in the literature over the past 2 years over this issue is considered, along with the published debate from the past 3 decades. The debate is not conclusive, but by presenting or referencing the specific case reports and the published opinions of various experts, we hope to enable the reader to make his or her own informed decision as to whether use of the topical preparation of chloramphenicol should be considered by the ophthalmological community.",1
4203,4203,21675912,Mutations in CYP24A1 and idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of rickets is one of the oldest and most effective prophylactic measures in medicine, having virtually eradicated rickets in North America. Given the potentially toxic effects of vitamin D, the recommendations for the optimal dose are still debated, in part owing to the increased incidence of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia in Britain in the 1950s during a period of high vitamin D supplementation in fortified milk products. We investigated the molecular basis of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia, which is characterized by severe hypercalcemia, failure to thrive, vomiting, dehydration, and nephrocalcinosis. METHODS: We used a candidate-gene approach in a cohort of familial cases of typical idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia with suspected autosomal recessive inheritance. Identified mutations in the vitamin D-metabolizing enzyme CYP24A1 were evaluated with the use of a mammalian expression system. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of CYP24A1, which encodes 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase, the key enzyme of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) degradation, revealed recessive mutations in six affected children. In addition, CYP24A1 mutations were identified in a second cohort of infants in whom severe hypercalcemia had developed after bolus prophylaxis with vitamin D. Functional characterization revealed a complete loss of function in all CYP24A1 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CYP24A1 mutations explains the increased sensitivity to vitamin D in patients with idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia and is a genetic risk factor for the development of symptomatic hypercalcemia that may be triggered by vitamin D prophylaxis in otherwise apparently healthy infants.",0

11797,11797,19318348,Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in the UK: 1995 to 2007,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDRTB) is a threat to global tuberculosis control. Limited information is, however, available on the outcome of XDRTB cases. This study describes the susceptibility to second- and third-line antituberculosis drugs among MDRTB cases and treatment outcome of identified XDRTB cases. METHOD: The results of second-line antituberculosis drug susceptibility tests in the UK between January 1995 and December 2007 were retrospectively reviewed and clinicians contacted for treatment outcome of XDRTB cases. Participants included all 678 patients with culture-confirmed MDRTB in the UK. The main outcome measures were the proportion of isolates resistant to second-line antituberculosis drugs and treatment outcome for XDRTB cases. RESULTS: Among MDRTB isolates, levels of resistance to amikacin, capreomycin, ciprofloxacin, cycloserine, ethionamide and p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) were 5.5, 3.4, 5.6, 5.1, 14.0 and 16.7%, respectively. Six XDRTB cases (0.9% of MDR cases) were identified during this period. Two further cases of XDRTB were reported in 2008. Five individuals with XDRTB died of tuberculosis within 3 years of diagnosis and three are still on treatment. CONCLUSION: Levels of MDRTB remain low, and those of XDRTB very low, in this high income country. The case fatality ratio among XDRTB cases was high despite low levels of HIV co-infection.",1
2592,2592,12774003,Propranolol plus placebo versus propranolol plus isosorbide-5-mononitrate in the prevention of a first variceal bleed: a double-blind RCT,"Nonselective beta-blockers are very effective in preventing first variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. Treatment with isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-MN) plus propranolol achieves a greater reduction in portal pressure than propranolol alone. The present multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial evaluated whether combined drug therapy could be more effective than propranolol alone in preventing variceal bleeding. A total of 349 consecutive cirrhotic patients with gastroesophageal varices were randomized to receive propranolol + placebo (n = 174) or propranolol + IS-MN (n = 175). There were no significant differences in the 1- and 2-year actuarial probability of variceal bleeding between the 2 groups (propranolol + placebo, 8.3% and 10.6%; propranolol + IS-MN, 5% and 12.5%). The only independent predictor of variceal bleeding was a variceal size greater than 5 mm. However, among patients with varices greater than 5 mm (n = 196), there were no significant differences in the incidence of variceal bleeding between the 2 groups. Survival was also similar. Adverse effects were significantly more frequent in the propranolol + IS-MN group due to a greater incidence of headache. There were no significant differences in the incidence of new-onset or worsening ascites or in impairment of renal function. In conclusion, propranolol effectively prevents variceal bleeding. Adding IS-MN does not further decrease the low residual risk of bleeding in patients receiving propranolol. However, the long-term use of this combination drug therapy is safe and may be an alternative in clinical conditions associated with a greater risk of bleeding.",0
10721,10721,15500418,Risks of testosterone replacement therapy in ageing men,"Testosterone has been available to practitioners for several decades. However, testosterone prescriptions have increased in recent years partly because of the introduction of newer delivery systems that are topical and have good bioavailability. In the US alone, approximately 2 million prescriptions for testosterone were written in 2002. This represents a 30% increase from 2001 and a 170% increase from 1999. There has also been a 500% increase in prescription sales in the past 10 years. The rise in prescriptions may be in part due to the increasing recognition of hypogonadism in ageing males or andropause. Treatment relating to hypogonadism has relieved symptoms and improved the quality of life of many individuals. Epidemiological studies point toward an association with increased morbidity and mortality, with low testosterone states in ageing males. For example, there is a higher prevalence of depression, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, fracture rates, frailty and even dementia with low testosterone states. Recently, there have been some concerns raised regarding the long-term safety of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) from the Institute of Medicine. Current evidence suggests no causal relationship between prostate cancer and physiological dosing of testosterone, especially with careful selection and monitoring of patients. Cardiovascular risks have, overall, been neutral, although suggestions have been made that there are positive vasodilatory properties with testosterone. Mild eythrocytosis can be a common side effect of TRT, but thromboembolic events have rarely been reported in the literature. This paper addresses the evidence to date regarding the safety aspects of TRT. The medical-legal implications of TRT for men at this point in time is also discussed.",1
6971,6971,31475793,Antithrombotic Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation with Stable Coronary Disease,"BACKGROUND: There are limited data from randomized trials evaluating the use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease. METHODS: In a multicenter, open-label trial conducted in Japan, we randomly assigned 2236 patients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) more than 1 year earlier or who had angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease not requiring revascularization to receive monotherapy with rivaroxaban (a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant) or combination therapy with rivaroxaban plus a single antiplatelet agent. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring revascularization, or death from any cause; this end point was analyzed for noninferiority with a noninferiority margin of 1.46. The primary safety end point was major bleeding, according to the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis; this end point was analyzed for superiority. RESULTS: The trial was stopped early because of increased mortality in the combination-therapy group. Rivaroxaban monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy for the primary efficacy end point, with event rates of 4.14% and 5.75% per patient-year, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.95; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Rivaroxaban monotherapy was superior to combination therapy for the primary safety end point, with event rates of 1.62% and 2.76% per patient-year, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.89; P?=?0.01 for superiority). CONCLUSIONS: As antithrombotic therapy, rivaroxaban monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy for efficacy and superior for safety in patients with atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease.

The aim of the Loire-Ardeche-Drome-Isere-Puy-de-Dome (LADIP) Trial of Atrial Flutter was 2-fold: (1) to prospectively compare first-line RFA (group I) versus cardioversion and amiodarone therapy (group II) after only 1 AFL episode; and (2) to determine the impact of both treatments on the long-term risk of subsequent atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: From October 2002 to February 2006, 104 patients (aged 78+/-5 years; 20 women) with AFL were included, with 52 patients in group I and 52 patients in group II. The cumulative risk of AFL or AF was interpreted with the use of Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by the log-rank test. Clinical presentation, echocardiographic data, and follow-up were as follows: age (78.5+/-5 versus 78+/-5 years), history of AF (27% versus 21.6%); structural heart disease (58% versus 65%), left ventricular ejection fraction (56+/-14% versus 54.5+/-14%), left atrial size (43+/-7 versus 43+/-6 mm), mean follow-up (13+/-6 versus 13+/-6 months; P=NS), recurrence of AFL (3.8% versus 29.5%; P<0.0001), and occurrence of significant AF beyond 10 minutes (25% versus 18%; P=0.3). Five complications (10%) were noted in group II (sick sinus syndrome in 2, hyperthyroidism in 1, and hypothyroidism in 2) and none in group I (0%) (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: RFA should be considered a first-line therapy even after the first episode of symptomatic AFL. There is a better long-term success rate, the same risk of subsequent AF, and fewer secondary effects.""",1
3258,3258,17202453,Dopamine agonists and the risk of cardiac-valve regurgitation,"BACKGROUND: Case reports and echocardiographic studies suggest that the ergot-derived dopamine agonists pergolide and cabergoline, used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and the restless legs syndrome, may increase the risk of cardiac-valve regurgitation. METHODS: We used data from the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database to identify a population-based cohort comprising 11,417 subjects 40 to 80 years of age who were prescribed antiparkinsonian drugs between 1988 and 2005. We conducted a nested case-control analysis within this cohort in which each patient with newly diagnosed cardiac-valve regurgitation was matched with up to 25 control subjects from the cohort, according to age, sex, and year of entry into the cohort. Incidence-rate ratios for cardiac-valve regurgitation with the use of different dopamine agonists were estimated by conditional logistic-regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 31 case patients with newly diagnosed cardiac-valve regurgitation, 6 were currently exposed to pergolide, 6 were currently exposed to cabergoline, and 19 had not been exposed to any dopamine agonist within the previous year. The rate of cardiac-valve regurgitation was increased with current use of pergolide (incidence-rate ratio, 7.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3 to 22.3) and cabergoline (incidence-rate ratio, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.5 to 15.6), but not with current use of other dopamine agonists. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, use of the dopamine agonists pergolide and cabergoline was associated with an increased risk of newly diagnosed cardiac-valve regurgitation.",0
10610,10610,15088997,Acute poisoning with autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale L.),"""INTRODUCTION: Colchicum autumnale, commonly known as the autumn crocus or meadow saffron, contains the antimitotic colchicine, which binds to tubulin and prevents it forming microtubules that are part of the cytoskeleton in all cells. CASE REPORT: A 71-year-old woman ate a plant she thought to be wild garlic (Allium ursinum). Ten hours later she arrived at the emergency department complaining of nausea, vomiting and watery diarrhea. Ingestion of a poisonous plant was suspected and she was treated with gastric lavage, oral activated charcoal and an infusion of normal saline. Toxicology analysis with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed colchicine in the patient's gastric lavage, blood (5 microg/l) and urine (30 microg/l). She developed arrhythmias, liver failure, pancreatitis, ileus, and bone marrow suppression with pancytopenia. Alopecia began in the third week. Treatment was supportive only. Five months later she had no clinical or laboratory signs of poisoning. DISCUSSION: The patient mistakenly ingested autumn crocus instead of wild garlic because of their great similarity. Colchicine primarily blocks mitosis in tissues with rapid cell turnover; this results in gastroenterocolitis in the first phase of colchicine poisoning, bone marrow hypoplasia with pancytopenia in the second and alopecia in the third, all of which were present in our patient. Colchicine toxicity in tissues without rapid cell turnover caused arrhythmias, acute liver failure and pancreatitis. CONCLUSION: Colchicine poisoning can result in gastroenterocolitis followed by multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. In unexplained gastroenterocolitis after ingestion of wild plants as a salad or spice, especially when wild garlic is mentioned, we should always consider autumn crocus. Diagnosis could be confirmed only by toxicology analyses. Management of colchicine poisoning is restricted to supportive therapy.""",1
8910,8910,7734010,Effect of lovastatin on early carotid atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Progression Study (ACAPS) Research Group,"""BACKGROUND: HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (or statins), a new class of lipid-lowering compounds, have raised expectations for more widespread use than that of the older lipid-lowering drugs. Not only are they more effective in lowering LDL cholesterol, but they are better tolerated as well. No data exist concerning the effect of statins on early carotid atherosclerosis and clinical events in men and women who have moderately elevated LDL cholesterol levels but are free of symptomatic cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lovastatin (20 to 40 mg/d) or its placebo was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial with factorial design along with warfarin (1 mg/d) or its placebo. This report is limited to the lovastatin component of the trial. Daily aspirin (81 mg/d) was recommended for everyone. Enrollment included 919 asymptomatic men and women, 40 to 79 years old, with early carotid atherosclerosis as defined by B-mode ultrasonography and LDL cholesterol between the 60th and 90th percentiles. The 3-year change in mean maximum intimal-medial thickness (IMT) in 12 walls of the carotid arteries was the primary outcome; change in single maximum IMT and incidence of major cardiovascular events were secondary outcomes. LDL cholesterol fell 28%, from 156.6 mg/dL at baseline to 113.1 mg/dL at 6 months (P < .0001), in the lovastatin groups and was largely unchanged in the lovastatin-placebo groups. Among participants not on warfarin, regression of the mean maximum IMT was seen after 12 months in the lovastatin group compared with the placebo group; the 3-year difference was statistically significant (P = .001). A larger favorable effect of lovastatin was observed for the change in single maximum IMT but was not statistically significant (P = .12). Five lovastatin-treated participants suffered major cardiovascular events--coronary heart disease mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke--versus 14 in the lovastatin-placebo groups (P = .04). One lovastatin-treated participant died, compared with eight on lovastatin-placebo (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: In men and women with moderately elevated LDL cholesterol, lovastatin reverses progression of IMT in the carotid arteries and appears to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events and mortality. Results from ongoing large-scale clinical trials may further establish the clinical benefit of statins.""",1

Correlation with light microscopic findings,"We used electron microscopy (EM) to analyze 52 biopsy samples from 22 patients who were receiving long-term weekly oral doses of methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Forty-eight biopsy samples were obtained after 2-6 years of continuous treatment, and 4 samples were obtained before treatment was begun. Specimens were graded for neutral fat, secondary and tertiary lysosomes, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) in hepatocytes, and for collagen in the perisinusoidal space (Disse's space). We examined the correlations between the EM findings and the light microscopic (LM) findings in the same biopsy specimens, and between the EM findings and the results of simultaneous monthly measures of aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and albumin levels, as well as history of alcohol consumption before MTX treatment and monthly assessments of clinical status during the course of treatment. The presence of collagen was minimally increased in these sequential biopsy samples, whereas fat, lysosomes, and SER were decreased. The SER decrease was statistically significant. EM findings of collagen in the space of Disse did not correlate with early fibrotic changes observed with LM. Thus, after as long as 6 years of weekly oral treatment with MTX, hepatic ultrastructural changes are minimal and are not clinically significant. The use of EM for sequential biopsy studies allows the quantitation of long-term hepatic changes that may be more limited than the impression gained after LM analysis.",1

Concomitant use of other medications might impact susceptibility to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. We investigated its association with administration of drugs that have been shown to modulate liver injury and/or repair in preclinical studies. METHODS: We analyzed data from 6386 cases of acetaminophen-associated liver injury that were defined in the FDA database of reported adverse events. Data reported in the severe adverse event categories of """"died"""" or """"life-threatening"""" (defined as """"fatal"""" cases, n = 2512) were compared with those of """"non-fatal"""" cases (n = 3874).

RESULTS: Among female subjects, concomitant use of statins, fibrates or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was associated with decreased likelihood of fatality, whereas ethanol use was associated with increased likelihood. Among male subjects, concomitant use of statins was associated with decreased likelihood of fatality, whereas concomitant use of sympathetic stimulants or ethanol was associated with increased likelihood. Concomitant use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor II antagonists was associated with decreased likelihood of fatality among younger subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant use of medications that have been shown in preclinical studies to modulate liver injury and/or repair influenced acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Drugs that reduce injury or increase repair are protective, whereas those that exacerbate injury or reduce repair are detrimental.""",1

This study analysed 126 patients with relapsed, advanced stage follicular lymphoma who received BEAM (BCNU [carmustine], cytarabine, etoposide, melphalan)-alemtuzumab allogeneic HSCT (BEAM-allo) (n = 44) or BEAM-autologous HSCT (BEAM-auto) (n = 82). The BEAM-allo group had a younger median age (48 years vs. 56 years, P < 0.001) but received a higher median number of therapies pretransplant (P = 0.015) compared with the BEAM-auto group. There was a higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) in the BEAM-allo group compared with the BEAM-auto group at 1 year (20% vs. 2%, P = 0.001). Older age and heavily pretreated patients were associated with a higher NRM and poorer survival in the BEAM-allo group. There was, however, a significantly lower relapse rate (20% vs. 43%, P = 0.01) at 3 years with BEAM-alemtuzumab, with no relapses after 2 years, compared with a continued pattern of relapse in the autologous group. No difference in overall survival (OS) (P = 0.99) or disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.90) was identified at 3 years, whereas a plateau in OS and DFS with crossing of the survival curves in favour of BEAM-allo group was observed. Furthermore, the ability to re-induce remissions with donor leucocytes provides additional benefit in favour of allogeneic HSCT. ",0

Safety of treatment was evaluated for all 67 patients; clinical efficacy, for 29; and bacteriologic efficacy, for 26. The average daily dose and duration of treatment for the 37 cefsulodin-treated patients were 5.6 g and 10.3 days, respectively. The percentage of total body surface burned was greater than or equal to 50% for 40% and greater than or equal to 25% for 85% of the patients. Rates of bacteriologic cure for 30 sites of infection were 64% (7/11) for skin and skin-structure infections treated with cefsulodin or reference antibiotics; 100% (1/1) for respiratory tract infections treated with cefsulodin and 33% (2/6) for those treated with reference antibiotics; and 100% (1/1) for septicemia treated with a reference antibiotic. Overall bacteriologic and clinical efficacy for cefsulodin treatment was 67% (8/12) and 73% (11/15), respectively, and for treatment with a reference antibiotic was 56% (10/18) and 64% (9/14), respectively.

Although the former was associated with significantly less bleeding within the first 24 hr of injection (p less than 0.05) but more postinjection pain (p less than 0.05) and esophageal stricture, there was a trend toward earlier obliteration of varices. This was most marked over the first three courses of injection, and although frequency of rebleeding was not significantly less, none of the 11 episodes in the sheath group were fatal, compared to 5 of 15 bleeds in those injected by the free-hand technique (p less than 0.05).",0
10270,10270,12691611,Liver failure caused by herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase plus ganciclovir therapy is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA depletion,"Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) converts ganciclovir (GCV) into an active compound, which can be incorporated into DNA molecules and terminate DNA synthesis. Gene transfer of HSV-tk followed by GCV administration has been used with success to treat experimental cancer and this strategy has entered into clinical trials. Although it is thought that the cytotoxic effect occurs mainly in tumoral dividing cells, where mitotic activity favors integration of the genotoxic compound into nuclear DNA, there are concerns of potential damage to normal nondividing cells. In the present work we have explored the mechanisms of HSV-tk/GCV toxicity and in particular whether this therapy may cause lesions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial dysfunction. We found that the administration of GCV to rats injected with adenovirus encoding HSV-tk induced hepatocellular damage characterized by the presence of apoptotic bodies, ballooning of hepatocytes, and severe hepatic steatosis with mitochondria enlargement and cristae dissolution at the ultrastructural level. Remarkably, Southern blot analysis showed substantial reduction in the amount of mtDNA in the liver. Using radiolabeled GCV we could demonstrate incorporation of this compound into both nuclear and mtDNA in HSV-tk-transduced rat hepatocytic cell line MCA-RH7777 and subsequent alteration of mitochondrial function. Our observations confirm that GCV can damage both nuclear and mtDNA in cells transduced with HSV-tk and that this effect could be responsible for severe mitochondrial dysfunction and toxicity in normal nondividing cells. These data are relevant for the design of clinical trials using adenoviral vectors encoding HSV-tk.",1

In an attempt to evaluate the impact of anti-HIV triple combination therapy on the course of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related chronic hepatitis and on HCV replication, we studied the biological and virological characteristics of 22 HCV/HIV-coinfected patients who were given triple combination therapy. In comparison with baseline values, there was (1) a significant increase in the CD4 and CD8 cell counts and a decrease in the HIV RNA load and (2) no significant variation in aminotransferase activities or the HCV RNA load at 3, 6, or 9 months of tritherapy. Antiretroviral tritherapy seems to modify neither the biological activity of HCV-related chronic hepatitis nor the HCV load, despite immune restoration.

12561,12561,22030947,"Effects of 1,3-dimethylamylamine and caffeine alone or in combination on heart rate and blood pressure in healthy men and women","BACKGROUND: The use of 1,3-dimethylamylamine (geranamine), alone and in combination with caffeine, is becoming widespread within the dietary supplement industry. To our knowledge, no data are available concerning the effects of oral geranamine intake on heart rate (HR) and blood pressure in individuals. METHODS: Ten young healthy men and women ingested 1 of 5 conditions on different days using a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. The following were ingested after a 10-hour overnight fast: 250 mg caffeine (C), 50 mg geranamine (G 50 mg), 75 mg geranamine (G 75 mg), 250 mg caffeine + 50 mg geranamine (C + G 50 mg), and 250 mg caffeine + 75 mg geranamine (C + G 75 mg). Heart rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and rate pressure product (RPP) were measured pre-ingestion and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-ingestion. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) were measured pre-ingestion and at 60 and 120 minutes post-ingestion. RESULTS: Heart rate was unaffected by treatment, but blood pressure and RPP were higher with geranamine, generally in a dose-dependent manner. The peak percent change from pre-ingestion in SBP (~20%), DBP (~17%), and RPP (~9%) was noted with C + G 75 mg at 60 minutes post-ingestion. Plasma NE and EPI were relatively unaffected by treatment. CONCLUSION: We report for the first time that acute ingestion of 1,3-dimethylamylamine alone and in combination with caffeine results in an increase in SBP, DBP, and RPP without an increase in HR. The largest increase is observed at 60 minutes post-ingestion of C + G 75 mg. These changes cannot be explained by circulating NE and EPI.",1

Mutations of the LIPA gene lead to Wolman disease (WD) and cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD). The disease hallmarks include hepatosplenomegaly and extensive storage of CE and/or TG. The effects of intravenous investigational enzyme therapy (ET) on survival and efficacy were evaluated in Lipa knock out, lal-/- mice with advanced disease using recombinant human LAL (rhLAL). Comparative ET was conducted with lower doses (weekly, 0.8 and 3.2mg/kg) beginning at 16 weeks (study 1), and with higher dose (10mg/kg) in early (8-weeks), middle (16-weeks) and late (24-weeks) disease stages (study 2). In study 1, rhLAL extended the life span of lal-/- mice in a dose dependent manner by 52 (0.8 mg/kg) or 94 (3.2mg/kg) days. This was accompanied by partial correction of cholesterol and TG levels in spleen and liver. In study 2, the high dose resulted in a significant improvement in organ size (liver, spleen and small intestine) and tissue histology as well as significant decreases in cholesterol and TG in all three groups. In the treated livers and spleens the cholesterol and TG levels were reduced to below treatment initiation levels indicating a reversal of disease manifestations, even in advanced disease. ET diminished liver fibrosis and macrophage proliferation. These results show that LAL deficiency can be improved biochemically and histopathologically by various dosages of ET, even in advanced disease.",1

Thus, the majority of FPHL patients remain untreated. Previously, we demonstrated that nonresponders to 5% minoxidil have low metabolism of minoxidil in hair follicles. As such, we hypothesized that increasing the dosage of topical minoxidil to low metabolizers would increase the number of responders without increasing the incidence of adverse events. In this study, we recruited FPHL subjects that were identified as non-responders to 5% topical minoxidil utilizing the previously validated assay for minoxidil response. Subjects were treated for 12 weeks with a novel 15% topical minoxidil solution. At 12 weeks, 60% of subjects achieved a clinically significant response based on target area hair counts (>13.7% from baseline), as well as significant improvement in global photographic assessment. None of the subjects experienced significant hemodynamic changes or any other adverse events.

We used logistic-regression models to estimate the relative risks of disease-specific types of chronic renal failure associated with the use of various analgesics RESULTS: Aspirin and acetaminophen were used regularly by 37 percent and 25 percent, respectively, of the patients with renal failure and by 19 percent and 12 percent, respectively, of the controls. Regular use of either drug in the absence of the other was associated with an increase by a factor of 2.5 in the risk of chronic renal failure from any cause. The relative risks rose with increasing cumulative lifetime doses, rose more consistently with acetaminophen use than with aspirin use, and were increased for most disease-specific types of chronic renal failure. When we disregarded the recent use of analgesics, which could have occurred in response to antecedents of renal disease, the associations were only slightly attenuated CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with the existence of exacerbating effects of acetaminophen and aspirin on chronic renal failure. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of bias due to the triggering of analgesic consumption by predisposing conditions.",0

Isoniazid, used for the prophylactic treatment of tuberculosis, is a potentially hepatotoxic drug. Carriers of the hepatitis B virus are likely to have some degree of liver damage due to their chronic infection. We hypothesized that prophylactic treatment of carriers with isoniazid would cause greater liver damage, as measured by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, than would such therapy of noncarriers. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of the southeast Asian refugee population in Philadelphia failed to support this hypothesis. Isoniazid did not cause greater hepatotoxicity in hepatitis B carriers than in noncarriers. Although carriers had higher ALT levels than noncarriers, both groups experienced transient ALT elevations during the first 2 months of isoniazid prophylactic therapy.

During the 2-year follow-up period, a similar number of clinical examinations were performed in the 2 groups (PRN: 14.0 ± 6.2; T&E 13.4 ± 4.4; P = 0.97), whereas the number of injections that were administered differed for the first (PRN: 5.5 ± 2.0 vs. T&E 6.8 ± 2.4; P = 0.008) and the second year (PRN: 1.9 ± 2.0 vs. T&E 3.8 ± 2.3; P = 0.002). The proportion of eyes with intraretinal fluid after the initial drug-loading phase remained stable (PRN: from 33.8% to 36.4%; T&E: from 25.6% to 29.0%); so, too, did the central retinal thickness and the visual acuity. Despite a limited sample size, this retrospective analysis revealed the anatomical and the functional improvements during the 2-year follow-up period to be not roughly different for the 2 strategies. However, when the PRN-approach is instigated, the risk of under-treatment due to lapses in visits or to over-extensions in the intervals between treatments may be underestimated. ",0

Adjunctive treatment with potent antiplatelet and antithrombin agents increases arterial patency but is associated with excessive bleeding. Cangrelor (formerly AR-C69931MX) is a rapidly acting, specific antagonist of platelet aggregation via binding to the adenosine diphosphate P2Y12 receptor subtype. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and coronary artery patency of cangrelor as an adjunct to alteplase (tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA]). METHODS: Patients with AMI received aspirin, heparin, and an intravenous infusion of either cangrelor alone, full-dose t-PA alone, or 1 of 3 doses of cangrelor along with half-dose t-PA. The primary end point was Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow at 60 minutes. Secondary end points included TIMI frame count, TIMI myocardial perfusion grade, extent of ST-segment resolution, composite clinical events, and bleeding. RESULTS: Ninety-two of planned 180 patients were enrolled. The combination of cangrelor and half-dose t-PA resulted in similar 60-minute patency as full-dose t-PA alone (55% vs 50%, P = not significant) and greater patency than with cangrelor alone (55% vs 18%, P < .05). The percentage of patients achieving >70% ST-segment resolution at 60 minutes tended to be greater with combination therapy than with either cangrelor or t-PA alone (28% vs 13%, P = .13 and 28% vs 14%, P = .30, respectively).

In a BRAF(V600E)-containing xenograft model of human melanoma, orally administered dabrafenib inhibited ERK activation, downregulated Ki67, and upregulated p27, leading to tumor growth inhibition. However, as reported for other BRAF inhibitors, dabrafenib also induced MAPK pathway activation in wild-type BRAF cells through CRAF (RAF1) signalling, potentially explaining the squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas arising in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. In addressing this issue, we showed that concomitant administration of BRAF and MEK inhibitors abrogated paradoxical BRAF inhibitor-induced MAPK signalling in cells, reduced the occurrence of skin lesions in rats, and enhanced the inhibition of human tumor xenograft growth in mouse models. Taken together, our findings offer preclinical proof of concept for dabrafenib as a specific and highly efficacious BRAF inhibitor and provide evidence for its potential clinical benefits when used in combination with a MEK inhibitor.",1

At the heart of the debate are three important questions: (1) the identity and composition of Ephedra products with regard to ephedrine and related alkaloids; (2) the potential therapeutic utility of Ephedra supplements for weight loss or performance enhancement; and (3) potential health risks associated with such uses of Ephedra, particularly in sensitive individuals or in cases of intentional abuse for its stimulant properties. This review surveys the literature on Ephedra with regard to traditional uses, botany, chemistry, analytics, pharmacological effects and health risks. A brief discussion of the central issues in the current debate on the regulation of Ephedra in the United States is included as this is where most of the problems have occurred to date.""",1
1564,1564,7760871,New neuromuscular blocking drugs,"The new nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs have specific advantages over succinylcholine. Rocuronium has an onset of action that is almost as rapid as that of succinylcholine and may be useful in patients with residual gastric contents. This drug may replace vecuronium, since the two agents are otherwise similar. The onset of action of mivacurium is similar to that of atracurium, but recovery from the blockade is more rapid (if the plasma cholinesterase level is normal), making mivacurium useful for short procedures. Although pipecuronium and doxacurium have minimal effects on the cardiovascular system, their long and variable onset and duration of action limit their usefulness. The need for either drug is questionable. There is still a need, however, for a nondepolarizing drug that has an onset of action as rapid as that of succinylcholine but a duration of action similar to that of mivacurium, with no adverse cardiovascular effects and clearance from the body that is independent of organ function.",0
13758,13758,25895618,Recent advances in the treatment of hyperammonemia,"Ammonia is a neurotoxic agent that is primarily generated in the intestine and detoxified in the liver. Toxic increases in systemic ammonia levels predominantly result from an inherited or acquired impairment in hepatic detoxification and lead to potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric symptoms. Inborn deficiencies in ammonia detoxification mainly affect the urea cycle, an endogenous metabolic removal system in the liver. Hepatic encephalopathy, on the other hand, is a hyperammonemia-related complication secondary to acquired liver function impairment. A range of therapeutic options is available to target either ammonia generation and absorption or ammonia removal. Therapies for hepatic encephalopathy decrease intestinal ammonia production and uptake. Treatments for urea cycle disorders eliminate ammoniagenic amino acids through metabolic transformation, preventing ammonia generation. Therapeutic approaches removing ammonia activate the urea cycle or the second essential endogenous ammonia detoxification system, glutamine synthesis. Recent advances in treating hyperammonemia include using synergistic combination treatments, broadening the indication of orphan drugs, and developing novel approaches to regenerate functional liver tissue. This manuscript reviews the various pharmacological treatments of hyperammonemia and focuses on biopharmaceutical and drug delivery issues.",1

Sixty-nine nucleoside-na?ve CHB patients with baseline HBV DNA of 10(8) copies/mL or more were randomized 1:1 to open-label treatment with entecavir 0.5 mg/day or adefovir 10 mg/day for a minimum of 52 weeks. The primary efficacy analysis compared mean reduction in HBV DNA at week 12 adjusted for baseline levels using linear regression. Entecavir was superior to adefovir for mean change from baseline in HBV DNA at week 12 (-6.23 log(10) copies/mL versus -4.42 log(10) copies/mL, respectively; mean difference -1.58 log(10) copies/mL; P < 0.0001). Both drugs demonstrated biphasic viral kinetics, with a first phase of rapid decline lasting 10 days. A significant difference favoring ETV was reached at day 10 (day 10 ETV-ADV difference estimate: -0.66 log(10) copies/mL; 95% CI [-0.30, -0.01]). Early virological response was found to be predictive of subsequent virological response, with those having lower HBV DNA levels at day 10 being more likely to achieve HBV DNA of less than 300 copies/mL at week 48. In addition, there was considerably less variability in the extent of HBV DNA reductions in patients treated with entecavir versus adefovir. Both the mean decrease in serum HBV DNA and the proportion of patients achieving HBV DNA less than 300 copies/mL were greater in entecavir-treated than adefovir-treated patients at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48. At week 48, one (3%) ETV-treated versus 15 (47%) ADV-treated patients had HBV DNA of 10(5) copies/mL or more. Both antivirals were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Entecavir therapy resulted in earlier and superior reduction in HBV DNA compared with adefovir in nucleoside-na?ve HBeAg-positive patients with CHB.",0

Preclinical studies of prostate cancer (PCa) have shown anti-tumor activity with digoxin. We explore the relationship between use of digoxin and PCa risk. Data from a population-based case-control study of incident cases aged 35-74 years at PCa diagnosis in 2002-2005 in King County, Washington were available. Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression. One thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10). Among those with ≥3 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years (546 cases, 380 controls), digoxin use was associated with a stronger reduction of PCa risk (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98). These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.

It is caused by the gallbladder twisting upon its mesentery leading to potential ischemia and biliary obstruction. A 77-year-old female presented with symptoms of right upper quadrant pain and nausea. She was found to have an elevated leukocytosis and a palpable right upper quadrant abdominal mass on exam. Imaging revealed a severely distended gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid and wall thickening without gallstones. Intraoperatively, an extremely distended, ischemic gallbladder was noted to have twisted upon its mesentery. The structures were able to be identified and the gallbladder was able to be safely removed with a laparoscopic approach despite its large size. Gallbladder volvulus is important to consider in the differential of acute cholecystitis because delay in intervention could lead to gallbladder necrosis and possible perforation, increasing the patient's morbidity and mortality.

DESIGN: Case report and literature review. SETTING: Intensive care unit. PATIENT: Adolescent with hemoglobin SC. INTERVENTIONS: Emergency treatment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 4 days of ceftriaxone therapy, the adolescent experienced an acute hemolytic reaction (hemoglobin decreased to 5 g/dL with hemoglobinuria) and severe hepatitis (all enzymes increasing dramatically including aminoaspartate transferase >20,000 IU/L). Renal failure and ultimately multiple organ failure ensued, and the patient died on hospital day 19. Direct antiglobulin tests on red cells obtained from the patient on hospital day 2 showed microscopic agglutination with polyspecific and anticomplement (C3) antiglobulin reagents. Plasma samples showed macroscopic agglutination reactions when incubated in the presence of ceftriaxone, many days after cessation of ceftriaxone, indicating the continued presence of ceftriaxone-dependent antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Drug reactions leading to hemolysis are relatively uncommon, and a total of ten cases of ceftriaxone-induced hemolytic anemia have been reported in children. The present case describes an adolescent who ultimately died on hospital day 19 from multiple organ failure, although the presentation of this case seems atypical in several respects. Children with clinical syndromes that place them at risk for hemolysis and children who frequently require broad spectrum antibiotics present unique diagnostic challenges, and the possibility that hemolytic syndromes may be due to ceftriaxone must be considered.",1
12309,12309,21207059,N-carbamylglutamate treatment for acute neonatal hyperammonemia in isovaleric acidemia,"Hyperammonemia occurs mainly in patients with branched-chain organic acidemias such as propionic, methylmalonic, and isovaleric acidemias. Its pathophysiological process is mainly via the competitive inhibition of N-acetylglutamate synthetase. Oral carglumic acid (N-carbamylglutamate) administration can correct hyperammonemia in neonates with propionic and methylmalonic acidemias, thus avoiding dialysis therapy. Isovaleric acidemia is an autosomal recessive disease of leucine metabolism due to deficiency of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase. For the first time, we report a neonate with isovaleric acidemia, whose plasma ammonia concentration dropped dramatically after one oral load of carglumic acid. This experience suggests that carglumic acid could be considered for acute hyperammonemia resulting from isovaleric acidemia. However, trials with more patients are needed.",1

Standard light microscopy lacks sensitivity for early fibrosis. DESIGN: This is a retrospective study of immunohistochemical markers of early fibrosis including laminin and fibronectin, collagen deposition and lipocyte activation in hepatic biopsies of 36 psoriatic patients treated with methotrexate for one to five years, at an average dose of 20 mg/week. Biopsies before initiation of methotrexate (n = 36) showed minimal immunohistochemical expression of desmin, transforming growth factor alpha, matrix proteins, and collagen. Expression of laminin, fibronectin, collagens III and IV increased significantly and progressively over baseline values after cumulative doses of 1.5 +/- 0.25 g (n = 20) and 3 +/- 0.5 g methotrexate, respectively. Increases in desmin, smooth muscle actin and collagen type I also occurred but the changes were less consistent. Light microscopic abnormalities of hepatotoxicity were not detectable in any of these biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical quantification of matrix proteins and collagens type III and IV may be early, sensitive and dose responsive markers of methotrexate hepatotoxicity which progress with increasing cumulative doses of methotrexate.",1

METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long-term safety extension study, nonhysterectomized women aged 40 to 80 years (n = 180) received daily oral doses of placebo, ospemifene 30 mg/day, or ospemifene 60 mg/day for 40 weeks (continued as blinded treatments from the initial 12-week pivotal efficacy study of ospemifene). The total treatment period was 52 weeks. Safety assessments included adverse events, cervical Papanicolaou tests, endometrial histology, endometrial thickness, gynecological examination, breast palpation, mammography, physical examination, and clinical safety laboratory assessments. RESULTS: No clinically significant adverse changes in safety assessments were observed in any treatment group. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Hot flushes, the most frequently occurring treatment-emergent adverse event related to the study drug, had a low discontinuation rate (1.6%). No study participants discontinued because of endometrial or cervical pathology; no endometrial findings were clinically meaningful. On week 52, more than 95% of endometrial biopsy samples either were classified as atrophic or inactive or had insufficient tissue for diagnosis. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events of pelvic organ prolapse or venous thromboembolism. No cases of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma were observed. Only three participants (1.7%) taking ospemifene experienced vaginal bleeding or spotting, which was self-limiting. CONCLUSIONS: Daily doses of ospemifene 30 mg and ospemifene 60 mg yielded few treatment-emergent adverse events and demonstrated no significant endometrial changes during the 1-year treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with a uterus.""",1
3193,3193,16525092,Efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in East Timor,"The efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in East Timor is unknown. We treated 38 individuals with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria with SP and monitored the outcome for 28 days. Recrudescent parasitemia, confirmed by genotyping, were detected in three individuals resulting in a late treatment failure rate of 7.9% (95% confidence interval = 1.7-21.4%). The results suggest that SP is still efficacious in treating uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in East Timor. However, the useful life of SP in East Timor may be limited because 80% of the parasites in our samples were found to already carry double mutations in P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (S108N/C59R). The data from this study also highlights that the presence of gametocytes may significantly influence the estimate of SP efficacy determined by genotyping. ",0
9637,9637,10542998,[Ticlopidine-induced cholestasis],"UNLABELLED: We report a case of ticlopidine-induced cholestatic hepatitis. CASE SUMMARY: An 82-year-old man suffered a myocardial infarction in February 1998. Because of persistent angina pectoris a coronary stent was implanted in May 1998. At this time medication with 1 x 250 mg ticlopidine was started in addition to the preexistent medication of aspirin 1 x 100 per day, metoprolol fumarate 1 x 95 mg per day and isosorbide dinitrate 1 x 100 mg per day. Three weeks after starting ticlopidine the patient complained of itching, and on day 28 painless jaundice developed. At this time, the serum activities of alkaline phosphatase (923 U/l), gamma-GT (823 U/l) and total bilirubin concentration (129 mumol/l) were markedly elevated, whereas the activities of the transaminases (AST 131 U/l, ALT 194 U/l) were slightly increased. An extra- or intrahepatic biliary obstruction was ruled out, and there were no signs of a toxic, infectious or immunological cause for the hepatic injury. Liver biopsy showed centro-acinar cholestasis. After drug discontinuation the itching stopped after 4 weeks and jaundice disappeared after 2 weeks. Eight months after the onset of symptoms, the activities of alkaline phosphatase (226 U/l) and gamma-GT (213 U/l) were still elevated but the patient was asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Ticlopidine-induced mild serum liver enzyme elevations have been observed in some studies (incidence 1-2%). The incidence of severe hepatitis has been estimated at 0.0013%. Only a few cases (in approximately 20 patients receiving ticlopidine) of a severe cholestatic pattern of injury have been reported. In all cases the jaundice resolved and serum liver enzyme concentrations normalised over a period of months. Characteristically, liver biopsies demonstrated centro-acinar cholestasis. Monitoring of serum liver enzyme concentrations is not recommended. When itching or jaundice occur in a patient taking ticlopidine, the possibility of toxic liver damage should be taken into account.",1

AIMS: To examine associations between kava use and potential health effects. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out within a kava-using east Arnhem Land Aboriginal community in tropical northern Australia. One-hundred-and-one adults who were current, recent or non-users of kava were enrolled in March 2000. Main outcome measures were physical, anthropometric, biochemical, haematological, immunological and neurocognitive assessments. RESULTS: Kava users more frequently showed a characteristic dermopathy (P<0.001). They had increased levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase (P<0.001). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in kava users (P<0.001). Fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and neurocognitive tests were not different between kava use categories. IgE and IgG antibodies were elevated across the whole group, as were C-reactive protein and homocysteine. CONCLUSIONS: Kava use was associated with dermopathy, liver function abnormalities and decreased lymphocytes. If kava continues to be used by Aboriginal populations, monitoring should focus on the health consequences of these findings, including a possible increase in serious infections. The interaction between kava, alcohol and other substances requires further study. Although markers of cardiovascular risk are increased across the population, these were not higher in kava users, and this increase may be linked to the large infectious pathogen burden reflective of the socioeconomic disadvantage seen in many remote Aboriginal communities.",1

6997,6997,32459923,FDA Initiative for Drug Facts Label for Over-the-Counter Naloxone,"""BACKGROUND: The opioid crisis highlights the need to increase access to naloxone, possibly through regulatory approval for over-the-counter sales. To address industry-perceived barriers to such access, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed a model drug facts label for such sales to assess whether consumers understood the key statements for safe and effective use. METHODS: In this label-comprehension study, we conducted individual structured interviews with 710 adults and adolescents, including 430 adults who use opioids and their family and friends. Eight primary end points were developed to assess user comprehension of each of the key steps in the label. Each of these end points included a prespecified target threshold ranging from 80 to 90% that was evaluated through a comparison of the lower boundary of the 95% exact confidence interval. RESULTS: The results for performance on six primary end points met or exceeded thresholds, including the steps """"Check for a suspected overdose"""" (threshold, 85%; point estimate [PE], 95.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 94.0 to 97.1) and """"Give the first dose"""" (threshold, 85%; PE, 98.2%; 95% CI, 96.9 to 99.0). The lower boundaries for four other primary end points ranged from 88.8 to 94.0%. One exception was comprehension of """"Call 911 immediately,"""" but this instruction closely approximated the target of 90% (PE, 90.3%; 95% CI, 87.9 to 92.4). Another exception was comprehension of the composite step of """"Check, give, and call 911 immediately"""" (threshold, 85%; PE, 81.1%; 95% CI, 78.0 to 83.9). CONCLUSIONS: Consumers met thresholds for sufficient understanding of six of eight components of the instructions in the drug facts label for naloxone use and came close on two others. Overall, the FDA found that the model label was adequate for use in the development of a naloxone product intended for over-the-counter sales.""",0
12609,12609,22171861,The health impacts of khat: a qualitative study among Somali-Australians,"OBJECTIVES: To identify patterns of khat use among Somali-Australians in Australia and to explore their views about the links between khat use and personal health. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Qualitative study using semistructured focus groups among adult members of Somali communities in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth who volunteered to attend focus groups in January and December 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Emergent themes related to Somali-Australians' understanding of the links between khat use and personal health. RESULTS: Nineteen focus groups included 114�participants. Khat use was reported to be common among the Somali community, and more common among men than women. Khat was usually chewed in prolonged sessions, producing mild psychostimulant effects such as increased energy, enhanced mood, reduced appetite and reduced sleep. Khat was widely perceived to be a food, not a drug, and as harmless, or even beneficial, to the user's health. Many users reported discontinuation effects such as lethargy, sleep disturbances and mood problems after sessions of heavy khat use, and some reported self-medicating with alcohol to cope with such problems. Problems of addiction to khat were identified by some participants, but not all believed it is addictive. Many khat users reported visiting their health professionals for treatment of adverse effects and failing to disclose their khat use. CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals require greater awareness of khat use and related health problems. Health promotion activities targeting communities with high levels of khat use are required to increase understanding of the potential risks of regular khat use, to promote harm-reduction strategies, and to increase awareness of services available for those experiencing harm. Health professionals should consider targeted screening for khat use among individuals from Horn of Africa communities who present to health services.",1

Most patients included were Afro-Caribbeans (26/28), and females (20/28). However, ethnic distribution did not reach significant conclusions. Annual incidence rate was estimated at 0.9/100,000. Medium incubation and duration were 33 and 66 days respectively. Two patients with grade 4 hepatitis died from the syndrome. Two thirds of the patients were given prednisone, which usually alleviated the systemic symptoms, but did not prevent their development (in 5 patients) nor death. Carbamazepine, allopurinol, and minocycline accounted for 2/3 of the cases. Sixty four percent of the causative prescriptions were judged inappropriate. DHS appeared as the most frequent type of severe systemic drug reaction in this population, and may largely be prevented by rational prescribing.",1

Forty-two patients(M:F = 30:12; mean age, 59.9 years) with liver metastases from colorectal cancer were treated with HAI using a totally implantable vascular access port system from July 1994 to March 1999. The regimen used here was so-called weekly high-dose 5-fluorouracil(5-FU) infusion(5-FU, 1,000 mg/m2/week). Volume measurement of the liver demonstrated not only whole liver atrophy including the tumor but also volume reduction of the non-tumorous lobe. Atrophic change of the liver was seen in patients who were administered over 20 g/m2 of 5-FU(p < 0.01). The CT attenuation values of the liver were examined, and fatty infiltration was seen in six patients. Histologic examination of liver biopsies from the non-tumorous part revealed steatosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the portal triad, which were not seen in specimens prior to HAI. On clinical laboratory findings, enzymes representing bile duct, including alkaline phosphatase, leucine amino peptidase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, were increased in 22 patients. In terms of regional toxicity for long-term HAI, 20 g/m2 of 5-FU, is the key dose at which to consider temporary cessation or dose reduction.""",1

The knee was positioned in 60 degrees of extension and the hip at 120 degrees of extension, with and without a backrest. The purpose of the study was to determine whether the use of a backrest resulted in greater force than when not using a backrest when the angle of back inclination was held constant and the support was varied. The results indicated that the addition of a backrest, when the body assumes an optimal position, enables the knee extensors to generate greater force then when no backrest is used. A backrest adds to the comfort and support of the subject performing resistive knee exercise and should be incorporated into the design of knee exercise units.",1
10011,10011,11778670,Hepatotoxicity in acute iron poisoning,"Although hepatotoxicity is a known sequela of acute iron poisoning, the literature describing it is confined to sporadic reports. Key issues such as prognosis and whether this is a dose-related phenomenon are not addressed. Review of this literature and of experimental animal studies demonstrates that it occurs early in the clinical course and has a relatively high mortality. The lowest acute serum iron concentration associated with hepatotoxicity was 1700 microg/dL (304 micromol/L). Since this greatly exceeds the reference range of 50-150 microg/dL (9-27 micromol/L), it supports a dose-related etiology. Unlike most other hepatotoxins, the periportal areas of the hepatic lobule are the primary sites of injury. As this is the principle sitefor hepatic regeneration, this accountsfor the relatively high mortality rate. An understanding of the pathogenesis of the hepatotoxicity of acute iron poisoning is central to the identification of rational and effective interventions. From the clinical perspective, the relatively high mortality rate of iron poisoning-induced hepatotoxicity requires vigilance for its onset and earlier consideration of liver transplantation.",1
7199,7199,615837,Hyperplasia and prolapse of hepatocytes into hepatic veins during longterm methyltestosterone therapy: possible relationships of these changes to the developement of peliosis hepatis and liver tumours,"We report the pathological changes in liver biopsies from 10 patients (four female transexuals and six impotent males) after treatment with 150 mg methyltestosterone daily for periods of up to 3 years, and in a hemihepatectomy specimen from a female transexual who developed a liver adenoma after 37 months of this treatment. Hepatocyte hyperplasia and mild focal sinusoidal dilatation was found in most cases. In some cases there were microcysts and dissociation of hepatocytes. In nine patients there was accumulation of hepatocytes between the endothelium and the supporting collagen of hepatic veins which often resulted in either partial occlusion of their lumina or disruption of their walls. These vascular changes do not appear to have been reported before. It is postulated that a single pathological process-hyperplasia, perhaps related to the anabolic effect of methyltestosterone--could be partly responsible both for the formation of cysts through mechanical obstruction of hepatic veins and for the formation of nodules and tumours.",1

Cases were clustered in the winter and spring with the peak in February and March. These coincided with the occurrence of influenza and, numerically, were associated more closely with influenza B than with influenza A. Six of the 58 cases were associated with chickenpox. Twenty-six children with RS were seen from 1963 to 1971, before the beginning of a systematic epidemiologic and virologic study. Viral infection was documented in either the patient or a contact in only 19% of those studied. Between 1971 and 1973, after the study was initiated, 16 cases of RS were diagnosed and viral infection was confirmed in 56% of these. In 1974, an epidemic of RS occurred during an influenza B epidemic and viral infection was found in either the patient or a contact in 81% of 16 cases. This study demonstrates that an association with viral infection can be proven in the majority of cases of RS when an intensive investigation is undertaken. During this study no significant environmental toxic exposures could be idenified. Most children had taken aspirin and other medications, and seven children had a history of excessive aspirin ingestion.",1
6777,6777,30768615,The impact of targeted malaria elimination with mass drug administrations on falciparum malaria in Southeast Asia: A cluster randomised trial,"The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) threatens global malaria elimination efforts. Mass drug administration (MDA), the presumptive antimalarial treatment of an entire population to clear the subclinical parasite reservoir, is a strategy to accelerate malaria elimination. We report a cluster randomised trial to assess the effectiveness of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) MDA in reducing falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence in 16 remote village populations in Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Lao People's Democratic Republic, where artemisinin resistance is prevalent. After establishing vector control and community-based case management and following intensive community engagement, we used restricted randomisation within village pairs to select 8 villages to receive early DP MDA and 8 villages as controls for 12 months, after which the control villages received deferred DP MDA. The MDA comprised 3 monthly rounds of 3 daily doses of DP and, except in Cambodia, a single low dose of primaquine. We conducted exhaustive cross-sectional surveys of the entire population of each village at quarterly intervals using ultrasensitive quantitative PCR to detect Plasmodium infections. The study was conducted between May 2013 and July 2017. The investigators randomised 16 villages that had a total of 8,445 residents at the start of the study. Of these 8,445 residents, 4,135 (49%) residents living in 8 villages, plus an additional 288 newcomers to the villages, were randomised to receive early MDA; 3,790 out of the 4,423 (86%) participated in at least 1 MDA round, and 2,520 out of the 4,423 (57%) participated in all 3 rounds. The primary outcome, P. falciparum prevalence by month 3 (M3), fell by 92% (from 5.1% [171/3,340] to 0.4% [12/2,828]) in early MDA villages and by 29% (from 7.2% [246/3,405] to 5.1% [155/3,057]) in control villages. Over the following 9 months, the P. falciparum prevalence increased to 3.3% (96/2,881) in early MDA villages and to 6.1% (128/2,101) in control villages (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.41 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.84]; p = 0.015). Individual protection was proportional to the number of completed MDA rounds. Of 221 participants with subclinical P. falciparum infections who participated in MDA and could be followed up, 207 (94%) cleared their infections, including 9 of 10 with artemisinin- and piperaquine-resistant infections. The DP MDAs were well tolerated; 6 severe adverse events were detected during the follow-up period, but none was attributable to the intervention. Added to community-based basic malaria control measures, 3 monthly rounds of DP MDA reduced the incidence and prevalence of falciparum malaria over a 1-year period in areas affected by artemisinin resistance. P. falciparum infections returned during the follow-up period as the remaining infections spread and malaria was reintroduced from surrounding areas. Limitations of this study include a relatively small sample of villages, heterogeneity between villages, and mobility of villagers that may have limited the impact of the intervention. These results suggest that, if used as part of a comprehensive, well-organised, and well-resourced elimination programme, DP MDA can be a useful additional tool to accelerate malaria elimination.

One hundred fourteen patients received rifampin/pyrazinamide in Wake County, North Carolina, between December 1999 and May 2002; 60.5% of these patients were homeless, and at least 17% drank alcohol to excess. Seventy-seven patients (67.5%) completed a full 2-month course. Nine patients had a history of viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease. Four of 114 (3.5%; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-8.7%) patients developed hepatitis on therapy, and another two had symptoms consistent with hepatitis but did not report for laboratory testing (total confirmed plus suspected hepatitis rate 5.3%; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-11.1%). No patient who developed hepatitis had a history of viral hepatitis or liver disease, and none had been previously treated with isoniazid. No patients died or were hospitalized due to drug side effects. Rifampin/pyrazinamide was associated with a significantly higher rate of hepatitis than previously described with isoniazid therapy for latent tuberculosis but resulted in a high completion rate. The rifampin/pyrazinamide regimen for latent tuberculosis infection may be useful for high-risk, traditionally nonadherent patient groups, but careful monitoring for toxicity is required.""",1

METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned 278 patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension (either idiopathic or associated with connective-tissue disease or with repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts) to placebo or sildenafil (20, 40, or 80 mg) orally three times daily for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 12 in the distance walked in six minutes. The change in mean pulmonary-artery pressure and World Health Organization (WHO) functional class and the incidence of clinical worsening were also assessed, but the study was not powered to assess mortality. Patients completing the 12-week randomized study could enter a long-term extension study. RESULTS: The distance walked in six minutes increased from baseline in all sildenafil groups; the mean placebo-corrected treatment effects were 45 m (+13.0 percent), 46 m (+13.3 percent), and 50 m (+14.7 percent) for 20, 40, and 80 mg of sildenafil, respectively (P<0.001 for all comparisons). All sildenafil doses reduced the mean pulmonary-artery pressure (P=0.04, P=0.01, and P<0.001, respectively), improved the WHO functional class (P=0.003, P<0.001, and P<0.001, respectively), and were associated with side effects such as flushing, dyspepsia, and diarrhea. The incidence of clinical worsening did not differ significantly between the patients treated with sildenafil and those treated with placebo. Among the 222 patients completing one year of treatment with sildenafil monotherapy, the improvement from baseline at one year in the distance walked in six minutes was 51 m. CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil improves exercise capacity, WHO functional class, and hemodynamics in patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension.",0

Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate (PHEN/TPM CR), as an adjunct to lifestyle modification, has previously shown significant weight loss compared with placebo in a 56-wk study in overweight and obese subjects with ?2 weight-related comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of PHEN/TPM CR in overweight and obese subjects with cardiometabolic disease. DESIGN: This was a placebo-controlled, double-blind, 52-wk extension study; volunteers at selected sites continued with original randomly assigned treatment [placebo, 7.5 mg phentermine/46 mg controlled-release topiramate (7.5/46), or 15 mg phentermine/92 mg controlled-release topiramate (15/92)] to complete a total of 108 wk. All subjects participated in a lifestyle-modification program. RESULTS: Of 866 eligible subjects, 676 (78%) elected to continue in the extension. Overall, 84.0% of subjects completed the study, with similar completion rates between treatment groups. At week 108, PHEN/TPM CR was associated with significant, sustained weight loss (intent-to-treat with last observation carried forward; P < 0.0001 compared with placebo); least-squares mean percentage changes from baseline in body weight were -1.8%, -9.3%, and -10.5% for placebo, 7.5/46, and 15/92, respectively. Significantly more PHEN/TPM CR-treated subjects at each dose achieved ?5%, ?10%, ?15%, and ?20% weight loss compared with placebo (P < 0.001). PHEN/TPM CR improved cardiovascular and metabolic variables and decreased rates of incident diabetes in comparison with placebo. PHEN/TPM CR was well tolerated over 108 wk, with reduced rates of adverse events occurring between weeks 56 and 108 compared with rates between weeks 0 and 56. CONCLUSION: PHEN/TPM CR in conjunction with lifestyle modification may provide a well-tolerated and effective option for the sustained treatment of obesity complicated by cardiometabolic disease. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00796367.""",1

9184,9184,8707404,Cancer incidence and mortality in women receiving estrogen and estrogen-progestin replacement therapy--long-term follow-up of a Swedish cohort,"We analyzed cancer incidence and mortality in a cohort of 22,597 Swedish women who were prescribed replacement hormones. After 13 years of follow-up in national registries, 2,330 incident cancer cases and 848 cancer deaths were observed. Overall, our results were reassuring since incidence rate ratios (SIRs) for 16 cancer sites and mortality ratios (SMRs) for all 10 examined sites were at, or lower than, unity. However, we found that exposure to an estrogen-progestin combined brand was associated with an increasing relative risk of breast cancer with follow-up time, the SIR reaching 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.8) after 10 years of follow-up. The relative risk of endometrial cancer was substantially increased, with the highest SIR of 5.0 (95% CI 1.6-5.9) in women prescribed estrogens alone, whereas those given an estrogen-progestin combination showed no elevation in risk. The risk estimates for liver and biliary tract cancers and for colon cancer were reduced by about 40%, notably in women prescribed the estradiol-progestin compound. Further detailed analyses revealed no evidence of adverse or protective effects on the risk of ovarian, uterine cervical, vulvar/vaginal, rectal, pancreatic, renal, lung, thyroid and other endocrine cancers, brain tumors, malignant melanoma or other skin cancers. Hormone replacement therapy was not associated with an increase in mortality for any cancer site, at this time of follow-up. For breast and endometrial cancers, SMRs were below baseline but tended to increase with follow-up time. We conclude that hormone replacement increases the endometrial-cancer risk after unopposed estrogens and the breast-cancer risk-notably after estrogen-progestin combined therapy-and tentatively suggest that it exerts a protective effect against colon and liver cancer risks.",1
7457,7457,1600269,Two fatal cases of hepatitis B virus carriers after corticosteroid therapy for bronchial asthma,We report two hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers who had liver failure after withdrawal of corticosteroids (steroids) administered for treatment of serious asthmatic attacks. Liver functions deteriorated 1 to 2 wk after withdrawal of the steroid therapy and liver failure occurred. Steroid readministration and intensive therapy for liver failure did not prevent death. An excessive immune response provoked by steroid withdrawal and decreased reserve capacity due to underlying chronic liver disease were thought to be factors in the liver failure. Caution must be exercised in the administration of steroids to patients with underlying chronic HBV infection to prevent exacerbation of hepatitis. Prompt readministration of steroids is indicated if evidence of liver failure develops.,1

HYPOTHESIS: This study was undertaken to compare the antianginal efficacy of trapidil with that of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) in patients with stable angina pectoris. METHODS: We studied 95 patients with stable angina pectoris who were randomized into a double-blind parallel group study with either oral trapidil or ISDN. After a 1-week run-in period and a 2-week wash-out phase, the patients received either trapidil 200 mg t.i.d. (n = 48) or ISDN 20 mg t.i.d. (n = 47) for 12 weeks. All antianginal medication, except sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), was discontinued during the study. Patients underwent an exercise electrocardiogram on an ergometer bicycle according to a modified Bruce protocol before and at 6 and 12 weeks during treatment. RESULTS: The workload capacity increased from 583 +/- 281 W.min before treatment to 833 +/- 444 W.min after 12 weeks of treatment in the trapidil group (p < 0.01) and from 555 +/- 276 W.min to 827 +/- 361 W.min in the ISDN group (p < 0.01). The anginal attacks per week as well as the use of GTN decreased significantly in both groups. After 12 weeks of therapy, the cumulative ST-segment depression during exercise decreased by 67% in the trapidil patients and by 23% in the ISDN patients. Compared with baseline, the double product at the 75 W level was reduced in both groups after 12 weeks of treatment. Blood pressure and heart rate at rest remained nearly unchanged. Overall, no statistical difference was found between the two study groups. The tolerability was good. CONCLUSION: Oral trapidil therapy is safe and effective in stable angina pectoris and is equivalent to standard therapy with ISDN.",1
5382,5382,25402658,"Isolation and characterization of a novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory tripeptide from enzymatic hydrolysis of soft-shelled turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) egg white: in vitro, in vivo, and in silico study","In this study, a novel angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory tripeptide (IVR) was isolated and identified from unfertilized soft-shelled turtle egg white (SSTEW). The IC50 value of IVR was measured in vitro as low as 0.81 ± 0.03 μM, and its inhibition type was suggested as competitive according to the Lineweaver-Burk plot. This peptide can be generated from either thermolysin followed by trypsin digestion (two stages) or only trypsin digestion (one stage). Quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis indicated that two-stage digestion gave 3.14 ± 0.17 mg of IVR from 1 g of SSTEW, better than that from one-stage digestion (1.31 ± 0.12 mg). In vivo antihypertensive activity of the tripeptide IVR after single oral administration (0.1 and 1 mg/kg of body weight) led to a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure 2-4 h after administration in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In addition, the binding mechanism of IVR has been rationalized through docking simulations using the testicular ACE (tACE)-lisinopril complex at 2 Å resolution (PDB 108A ). The best docking pose was located at the tACE catalytic site resembling the mode of inhibition exerted by lisinopril, an effective hypertensive synthetic drug. The degree of inhibition of this peptide correlated with the H-bond interaction between the C-terminal of IVR and Lys511 and Tyr520 residues of tACE, a significant inhibitor registration for lisinopril. This study illustrated that IVR behaves as a transition-state analogue inhibitor and is useful in therapeutic intervention for blood pressure control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an efficient ACE-inhibitory tripeptide generated from the unfertilized egg of soft-shelled turtle.  ",0

The sample comprised 487 women with fibromyalgia (52.1 ± 8 yr) and 250 control women (49.3 ± 9 yr). We assessed physical fitness using the arm curl, 30-s chair stand, handgrip strength, 8-ft up and go, 6-min walk, chair sit and reach, and the back scratch tests. The revised fibromyalgia impact questionnaire was used to assess fibromyalgia severity and symptomatology. Patients with fibromyalgia performed worse than control women in all the fitness tests studied (all, P < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that all the fitness tests were able to discriminate between presence and absence of fibromyalgia (all, P < 0.001). The area under the curve ranged from 0.708 to 0.910 (all, P < 0.001). Among the fitness tests studied, the arm curl test, followed by the 30-s chair-stand and handgrip strength tests, showed the highest capacity discriminating between the presence and absence of fibromyalgia. An arm curl test score of <20 repetitions was associated with increased odds of having fibromyalgia (odds ratio (OR), 35.6; 95% confidence interval, 12.6-101) in women age 35-44 yr. An arm curl test score of <16 repetitions was associated with increased odds of having fibromyalgia (OR, 23.7; 95% confidence interval, 10.3-54.0) in women age 35-44 yr. In the group of women age 55-65 yr, the highest OR was observed for the handgrip strength test and the odds of having fibromyalgia was 17 times greater than that in patients who performed less than 19 kg. The arm curl, 30-s chair stand, and handgrip strength tests powerfully discriminated women with fibromyalgia from healthy women. Identification of women who fail to meet the suggested standards can help to easily, quickly, and cheaply rule out the presence of the disease, especially in primary care settings. ",0

3116,3116,16507146,Cytokine polymorphisms influence treatment outcomes in SLE patients treated with antimalarial drugs,"Antimalarial agents have been widely used as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other rheumatological diseases, although their mechanism of action has not yet been fully defined. It is known, however, that effective response to treatment is variable among patients. Thus, the identification of genetic predictors of treatment response would provide valuable information for therapeutic intervention. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of antimalarial treatment on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha serum levels and evaluate the possible influence of TNFalpha and IL-10 functional genetic polymorphisms on the response to antimalarial drugs. To this end, TNFalpha serum levels were quantified in 171 SLE patients and 215 healthy controls by ELISA techniques and polymorphisms at positions -1,082 and -308 of the IL-10 and TNFalpha gene promoters were determined by PCR amplification followed by hybridization with fluorescent-labeled allele-specific probes in 192 SLE patients and 343 matched controls. Data were related to clinical features and treatment at the time of sampling and during the course of the disease. Results showed a significantly higher amount of serum TNFalpha in the entire SLE population compared with controls. However, TNFalpha serum levels correlated negatively with the use of antimalarial treatment during at least three months before sampling. Patients under single or combined treatment with these drugs had TNFalpha serum levels similar to healthy controls, whereas untreated patients and those under corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapies had increased amounts of this cytokine. This suggests, however, that antimalarial-mediated inhibition of TNFalpha was only significant in patients who were genetically high TNFalpha or low IL-10 producers. In addition, evaluation of SLE patients administered antimalarial drugs for three or more years who did not require any other specific SLE treatment indicates that patients with the combined genotype low IL-10/high TNFalpha are the best responders to antimalarial therapy, developing mild disease with a good course under this treatment. In conclusion, we proposed that an antimalarial-mediated downregulation of TNFalpha levels in SLE patients is influenced by polymorphisms at IL-10 and TNFalpha promoters. Our results may thus find important clinical application through the identification of patients who are the most likely to benefit from antimalarial therapy. ",0

A similar proportion of patients achieved and maintained castration levels of serum testosterone (?50 ng/dl) with all triptorelin formulations. Moreover, using a stricter definition of medical castration (serum testosterone <20 ng/dl), castration was maintained in >90% of patients with the 6-month triptorelin formulation. The new formulation was also well-tolerated, whilst being more convenient for patients. This short review assesses the role of this GnRH agonist in the treatment of prostate cancer.",1

Acute Cd hepatotoxicity has been well studied in experimental animals; however, effects of prolonged exposure to Cd doses on the liver remain unclear. In the present study, to evaluate chronic Cd hepatotoxicity, we examined specimens from cases of itai-itai disease, the most severe form of chronic Cd poisoning. We compared 89 cases of itai-itai disease with 27 control cases to assess Cd concentration in organs. We also examined 80 cases of itai-itai disease and 70 control cases for histopathological evaluation. In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry for metallothionein, which binds and detoxifies Cd. Hepatic Cd concentration was higher than Cd concentration in all other organs measured in the itai-itai disease group, whereas it was second highest following renal concentration in the control group. In the liver in the itai-itai disease group, fibrosis was observed at a significantly higher rate than that in the control group. Metallothionein expression was significantly higher in the itai-itai disease group than that in the control group. Prolonged exposure to low doses of Cd leads to high hepatic accumulation, which can then cause fibrosis; however, it also causes high expression of metallothionein, which is thought to reduce Cd hepatotoxicity.""",1

The delayed diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the presence of acute portal vein thrombosis can be avoided by using spiral-computed tomography and careful investigation of signs of appendicitis. ,0

Forty-eight percent of the 42 patients treated with L-carnitine survived, but only 10% of the 50 patients treated solely with aggressive supportive care survived (p < 0.001). Early intervention with IV rather than enteral L-carnitine was associated with the greatest hepatic survival. Specifically, all 10 patients who were diagnosed in <5 days and treated with IV L-carnitine survived. Most patients had features of chronic illness and most children appeared to be malnourished.",1
12632,12632,22265699,Lithium toxicity profile: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"""BACKGROUND: Lithium is a widely used and effective treatment for mood disorders. There has been concern about its safety but no adequate synthesis of the evidence for adverse effects. We aimed to undertake a clinically informative, systematic toxicity profile of lithium. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies. We searched electronic databases, specialist journals, reference lists, textbooks, and conference abstracts. We used a hierarchy of evidence which considered randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and case reports that included patients with mood disorders given lithium. Outcome measures were renal, thyroid, and parathyroid function; weight change; skin disorders; hair disorders; and teratogenicity. FINDINGS: We screened 5988 abstracts for eligibility and included 385 studies in the analysis. On average, glomerular filtration rate was reduced by -6.22 mL/min (95% CI -14.65 to 2.20, p=0.148) and urinary concentrating ability by 15% of normal maximum (weighted mean difference -158.43 mOsm/kg, 95% CI -229.78 to -87.07, p<0.0001). Lithium might increase risk of renal failure, but the absolute risk was small (18 of 3369 [0.5%] patients received renal replacement therapy). The prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism was increased in patients taking lithium compared with those given placebo (odds ratio [OR] 5.78, 95% CI 2.00-16.67; p=0.001), and thyroid stimulating hormone was increased on average by 4.00 iU/mL (95% CI 3.90-4.10, p<0.0001). Lithium treatment was associated with increased blood calcium (+0.09 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.02-0.17, p=0.009), and parathyroid hormone (+7.32 pg/mL, 3.42-11.23, p<0.0001). Patients receiving lithium gained more weight than did those receiving placebo (OR 1.89, 1.27-2.82, p=0.002), but not those receiving olanzapine (0.32, 0.21-0.49, p<0.0001). We recorded no significant increased risk of congenital malformations, alopecia, or skin disorders. INTERPRETATION: Lithium is associated with increased risk of reduced urinary concentrating ability, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and weight gain. There is little evidence for a clinically significant reduction in renal function in most patients, and the risk of end-stage renal failure is low. The risk of congenital malformations is uncertain; the balance of risks should be considered before lithium is withdrawn during pregnancy. Because of the consistent finding of a high prevalence of hyperparathyroidism, calcium concentrations should be checked before and during treatment.

7999,7999,3623575,Accidental poisoning in childhood: a multicentre survey. 1. General epidemiology,"""As background to a study of the effectiveness of packaging in preventing childhood poisoning, the National Poisons Information Service coordinated a prospective survey, in which 9 Accident and Emergency (A & E) departments and 5 paediatric departments, between July 1982 and February 1984, recorded 2043 cases of suspected accidental poisoning in children aged 0-60 months. The products implicated were drugs (59%), household products (37%) and plants (3%). The drugs most frequently implicated were analgesics, anxiolytics, cough medicines, oral contraceptives and drugs to supplement diet or treat dietary disorders. The most frequently implicated household products were cleaners such as bleach, detergent and disinfectant, and petroleum distillate. Seventy-five per cent of the children were 2 and 3-year-olds. Fifty-six per cent were male. Only 22% of the children had signs or symptoms on admission. In only 2 cases were these serious. Treatment other than ipecacuanha and/or oral fluids was seldom required. Of the cases where outcome was recorded, 56% were discharged from A & E. The rest were admitted to a ward; only 7 children were admitted to intensive care units. No child died. Comparison with HASS and other epidemiological surveys shows that these results are representative of national trends.""",1

8613,8613,6614680,Oral zinc therapy for Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper accumulation that is fatal if untreated. Because penicillamine, the established treatment, is toxic in a substantial number of patients, we studied the efficacy of zinc treatment. We induced a negative or neutral copper balance in five out of five patients with Wilson's disease who were receiving no therapy other than zinc. Zinc acetate was given every 4 hours during the day, and the patient was not allowed to eat for 1 hour before and 1 hour after each dose. Oral zinc therapy, used according to our regimen, may now be considered in the treatment of patients with penicillamine intolerance. However, it is premature to convert patients to zinc therapy if they tolerate penicillamine well. The efficacy of zinc therapy in the initial removal of the copper burden in acutely ill patients with Wilson's disease has not yet been evaluated.",1
7993,7993,3596172,Cyclosporin A-induced cholestasis. The mechanism in a rat model,"Cyclosporin A (CyA) causes cholestasis in a significant proportion of transplant patients. Doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg CyA/kg body wt or the Miglyol 812 vehicle were administered intraperitoneally for 1, 2, and 3 wk to separate groups of rats to investigate the mechanism of this cholestasis. At 1 wk a dose-response relationship between serum CyA levels and increasing CyA doses was noted. A maximum CyA blood level was achieved by 2 wk with the 10- and 15-mg/kg doses. Subsequent studies were performed using the smaller (10 mg/kg) dose administered for 3 wk. This dose resulted in a marked increase in serum bile acid levels compared with vehicle-treated controls (24.6 +/- 4.0 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.2 mumol/L, p less than 0.001) without inducing significant changes in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin levels or hepatic architectural alterations. With CyA treatment, baseline bile flow decreased by 35% and bile salt secretion decreased by 25% compared with vehicle-treated animals. Cyclosporin A and vehicle-treated rats were infused intravenously with taurocholate (4 mumol/min X kg) for 2 h and then depleted of bile salts over the next 24 h. Bile samples collected over this period were graphed as bile salt secretion versus bile flow. The mean slope of the linear regression for the CyA-treated rats was 62% of the control, demonstrating a decrease in bile salt-dependent flow. Extrapolation of the linear regression to the ordinate demonstrated a 22% decrease in bile-independent flow with CyA treatment. Therefore, in our experimental model of CyA-induced cholestasis, the decrease in flow observed was the result of a decrease in both bile salt-dependent and bile salt-independent flows and occurred in the absence of significant biochemical or histologically evident hepatotoxicity.",1

The composition and purity of such products is not known. To determine the chemical identity and the amounts of ingredients in dietary supplements and products marketed and sold through the internet as selective androgen receptor modulators and compare the analyzed contents with product labels. Web-based searches were performed from February 18, 2016, to March 25, 2016, using the Google search engine on the Chrome and Internet Explorer web browsers to identify suppliers selling selective androgen receptor modulators. The products were purchased and the identities of the compounds and their amounts were determined from April to August 2016 using chain-of-custody and World Anti-Doping Association-approved analytical procedures. Analytical findings were compared against the label information. Products marketed and sold as selective androgen receptor modulators. Chemical identities and the amount of ingredients in each product marketed and sold as selective androgen receptor modulators. Among 44 products marketed and sold as selective androgen receptor modulators, only 23 (52%) contained 1 or more selective androgen receptor modulators (Ostarine, LGD-4033, or Andarine). An additional 17 products (39%) contained another unapproved drug, including the growth hormone secretagogue ibutamoren, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-δ agonist GW501516, and the Rev-ErbA agonist SR9009. Of the 44 tested products, no active compound was detected in 4 (9%) and substances not listed on the label were contained in 11 (25%). In only 18 of the 44 products (41%), the amount of active compound in the product matched that listed on the label. The amount of the compounds listed on the label differed substantially from that found by analysis in 26 of 44 products (59%). In this limited investigation involving chemical analyses of 44 products marketed as selective androgen receptor modulators and sold via the internet, most products contained unapproved drugs and substances.

DESIGN: Case note review. SETTING: Three intensive care units. SUBJECTS: Five children with upper respiratory tract infections aged between 4 weeks and 6 years. RESULTS: Four patients had laryngotracheo-bronchitis and one had bronchiolitis. All were sedated with propofol. The clinical course in all five cases was remarkably similar: an increasing metabolic acidosis was associated with brady-arrhythmia and progressive myocardial failure, which did not respond to resuscitative measures. All children developed lipaemic serum after starting propofol. These features are not usually associated with respiratory tract infections. No evidence was found of viral myocarditis, which was considered as a possible cause of death. CONCLUSION: Although the exact cause of death in these children could not be defined, propofol may have been a contributing factor.",1

This apparent protection does not extend to chronic or repeated high dose acetaminophen administration. The Illinois Poison Center (IPC) was consulted on a case involving a 7 month old 17 lb infant, who had presented the day prior to an emergency department with complaint of febrile illness. Patient had been prescribed acetaminophen for symptoms, and the mother called IPC when she realized that she had been incorrectly giving the patient concentrated infant acetaminophen (80 mg per 0.8 mL) totalling 42.3 mg/kg/dose or 234 mg/kg/24 hours instead of children's acetaminophen (160 mg/5 ml). Per recently published national triage guidelines, the patient was referred to an acute care facility for evaluation. The patient presented with significantly elevated aspartate aminotransferrase (AST) and alanine aminotransferrase (ALT) levels of 1339 and 907 U/L respectively, and was initiated on i.v. n-acetylcysteine therapy. The patient responded well to therapy, with AST and ALT declining to 145 and 479 U/L respectively over the next 48 hours. This case represents one of the shortest durations of chronic acetaminophen therapy to cause hepatic injury in an infant. Further, while the level was only slightly above the national triage guideline recommended referral dose per 24 hours, significant hepatotoxicity was observed.",1

There is concern that sirolimus may be associated with wound complications and hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). We have used sirolimus as primary immunosuppression in 170 liver transplant recipients and therefore reviewed our experience with wound complications and HAT in our cohort of patients. Records of all 170 patients administered sirolimus as primary immunosuppression and 180 historic controls were reviewed. Numbers of wound and hepatic artery complications were recorded, as well as the prevalence of obesity, reoperation, diabetes, and OKT3 use, all of which are risk factors for wound complications. The prevalence of wound complications was 12.4% in sirolimus-treated patients compared with 13.9% in historic controls (P = not significant [NS]). The prevalence of hepatic artery complications was 5.3% in sirolimus-treated patients compared with 8.3% in historic controls (P = NS). The prevalence of obesity and OKT3 administration was significantly lower in sirolimus-treated patients. Multivariate analysis failed to show an association between sirolimus therapy and hepatic artery or wound complications.

2213,2213,10377229,New (sulfonyloxy)piperazinyldibenzazepines as potential atypical antipsychotics: chemistry and pharmacological evaluation,"A series of 2- or 8-trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy (TfO) and 2- or 8-methylsulfonyloxy (MsO) 11-piperazinyldibenzodiazepines, -oxazepines, and -thiazepines were synthesized and evaluated in pharmacological models for their potential clozapine-like properties. In receptor binding assays, the 2-TfO analogues (18a, GMC2-83; 24, GMC3-06; and previously reported GMC1-169, 9a) of the dibenzazepines have profiles comparable to that of clozapine, acting on a variety of CNS receptors except they lack M1 receptor affinity. Introduction of 2-TfO to clozapine leads to compound 9e (GMC61-39) which has a similar binding profile as that of clozapine including having M1 receptor affinity. Interestingly, the MsO analogues, as well as the 8-TfO analogues, have no or weak dopaminergic and serotonergic affinities, but all 8-sulfonyloxy analogues do have M1 affinities. In behavioral studies performed to indicate the potential antipsychotic efficacy and the propensity to induce EPS, 2-TfO analogues blocked effectively the apomorphine-induced climbing in mice in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 values (mg/kg) of 2.1 sc for 9a, 1.3 po for 18a, 2.6 sc for 24, and 8.2 sc for 9e. On the other hand, they showed a clear dose separation with regard to their ED50 values (mg/kg) for indicating catalepsy in rats (>44 sc for 9a, 28 po for 18a, 30 sc for 24, and >50 sc for 9e, respectively), thus implicating a more favorable therapeutic ratio (K/A, ED50 climbing/ED50 catalepsy) in comparison with typical neuroleptics such as haloperidol and isoclozapine. Furthermore, compound 18a was also demonstrated to be an orally potent DA antagonist with an ED50 value of 0.7 mg/kg po in the ex vivo L-DOPA accumulation model. The present study contributes to the SAR of 11-piperazinyldibenzazepines, and the 2-TfO analogues of 11-piperazinyldibenzazepines are promising candidates as clozapine-like atypical antipsychotics with low propensity to induce EPS.

7716,7716,2593049,Animal model of margosa oil ingestion with Reye-like syndrome. Pathogenesis of microvesicular fatty liver,"The aetiology and pathogenesis of Reye's syndrome (RS) are incompletely understood. A number of environmental toxins and biological agents, including viruses, have been postulated to cause RS, either acting alone or synergistically. Most investigations have suggested that the primary insult is in the liver mitochondria, leading to a complex biochemical catastrophe, with death from encephalopathy. Margosa oil (MO), a long-chain fatty acid compound, has been shown to cause a Reye-like syndrome with death from hepatoencephalopathy, in children in Malaysia and India. The present time-course study performed in MO-administered mice showed the development of hepatic lesions with many features of RS. MO acts rapidly, within 30 min, on the nuclei of hepatocytes inducing mitoses and binucleated cells. This is followed by mitochondrial injury, with swelling, rarefaction of matrix, loss of dense bodies, pleomorphism, and loss of ribosomes starting at 60 min. There is loss of liver glycogen, and proliferation and hypertrophy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), followed by the presence of lipid droplets in the hyaloplasm, and globules within dilated cisterns of the ER. Additional fatty acids from lipolysis of body adipocytes, and fat globules from intestinal MO ingestion further aggravate the liver fatty change. There is evidence of fat globule ingestion by endocytosis into hepatocytes at the level of the sinusoids. The development of microvesicular liver steatosis and glycogen depletion due to involvement of liver cell organelles occur rapidly as in RS.",1
12073,12073,20304628,Phase II trial of the histone deacetylase inhibitor belinostat in women with platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer and micropapillary (LMP) ovarian tumours,"AIM: Micropapillary/borderline (LMP) ovarian tumours are rarely included in clinical trials and are intrinsically resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. Platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has a poor prognosis. The histone deacetylase inhibitor belinostat demonstrated antitumour activity in pre-clinical ovarian cancer models. METHODS: A phase II study was performed to evaluate the activity of belinostat in two patient populations: women with metastatic or recurrent platinum resistant (progression within 6 months) EOC and LMP ovarian tumours, both groups had received no more than 3 prior lines of chemotherapy. Belinostat 1000 mg/m(2)/d was administered iv days 1-5 of a 21 d cycle. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tumour biopsies, where possible, for correlative studies were obtained prior to and following treatment. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with EOC and 14 patients with LMP tumours were enrolled on study. Belinostat was well tolerated with no grade four toxicity (179 cycles). Grade 3 toxicity consisted of thrombosis (3 patients), hypersensitivity (1) and elevated ALP (1). One patient with LMP tumour had a partial response (unconfirmed) and 10 had stable disease (SD), 3 were non-evaluable. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.4 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 5.6--not reached). Best response in patients with EOC was SD (nine patients) and median PFS was 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.2-5.7 months). An accumulation of acetylated histones H3 and H4 was noted in PBMCs and in tumour tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Belinostat is well tolerated in both patient groups and shows some activity in patients with micropapillary (LMP) disease.",1
6197,6197,28942404,Successful treatment using rituximab in a patient with refractory polymyositis complicated by scleroderma renal crisis,"Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for patients with inflammatory myopathies. Myositis can be a clinical feature of scleroderma (polymyositis-scleroderma overlap syndrome), and treatment of this syndrome is a challenge for clinicians because moderate to high doses of corticosteroids are considered a risk factor for development of acute kidney injury in affected patients. We report here the case of a 56-year-old woman with scleroderma who developed polymyositis and was successfully treated with rituximab. Initial treatment of the polymyositis with prednisolone 40 mg/day was rapidly tapered to 2.5 mg/day due to development of scleroderma renal crisis, for which four weekly infusions of rituximab (500 mg; off-label) were given. She responded well to rituximab in addition to prednisolone 2.5 mg/day. Rituximab may improve inflammatory myopathies, even in cases where high-dose corticosteroids should be avoided due to complications. Rituximab should be considered as a treatment option in cases of refractory polymyositis. ",0

A single 0.5 mg/kg (0.00133 mmol/kg) oral dose of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol was administered to seven Chinese schizophrenics in a randomized crossover manner separated by a 2-week interval. The clearance values for the different metabolic pathways of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol were determined. There were differences up to 10-fold in both oxidation and reduction capacities. There were also interindividual variabilities in the elimination of reduced haloperidol (0.37 +/- 0.20 L/hr/kg) and the N-dealkylation pathway (0.74 +/- 0.36 L/hr/kg). Four weeks after the single-dose study, the same patients also received haloperidol (10 mg) twice daily for 4 weeks. The reduced haloperidol to haloperidol concentration ratio (0.40 +/- 0.16) after the 4-week therapy is related to individual variabilities in the interconversion process and the N-dealkylation pathway of haloperidol.

Liver biopsies showed severe focal inflammation. The biopsy findings and the subsequent clinical course of the patients strongly suggest that these abnormalities were due to hepatic toxicity of the chemotherapy and not metastic breast cancer. A review of serial liver function tests performed on 24 patients in that chemotherapy program revealed that four out of eight patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase prior to therapy developed early metastatic cancer. Elevated alkaline phosphatase occurring during chemotherapy on the other hand was quite common but more likely due to hepatic toxicity of the drugs. The development of abnormal liver function tests even in association with focal defects on liver scan is not sufficient to diagnose metastatic breast cancer in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.",1
7595,7595,2125388,Vascular hepatotoxicity related to heroin addiction,"""The hepatotoxic effect of heroin has been demonstrated in liver biopsies by morphometric analysis of four groups of patients: twenty-one drug abusers (DA) at the time of the biopsy, eighteen patients who had stopped drug consumption for at least six months (ex-DA), twelve patients with post-transfusional chronic active hepatitis (PTCAH), and eleven controls (CONTROL). Semiquantitative assessment showed the extent of sinusoidal dilatation and the inflammatory and fibrotic reaction in the terminal hepatic vein (THV). Thickening and cellularity of the venular wall and the volume density of sinusoidal lumen (Vsl) in the Zone I and III of the hepatic acinus, were also evaluated. The morphometric analysis used computerized measurements. In DA, the sinusoidal dilatation (100% of cases), the sinusoidal and THV inflammation (81% and 67.7%, respectively), localized mainly in the centrilobular zone, were more pronounced than in ex-DA, in patients with PTCAH and in CONTROL (significantly different P less than 0.0001). Conversely, the fibrotic reaction (perisinusoidal fibrosis--44.4% and perivenular fibrosis--61.1%) was more frequent in ex-DA. The THV inflammation in DA was replaced by a fibrotic matrix deposit in the THV wall (wall surface/internal surface = 2.72 +/- 0.37 in ex-DA; 1.38 +/- 0.32 in DA; 0.87 +/- 0.14 in PTCAH and 0.45 +/- 0.03 in CONTROL--significantly different P less than 0.001), associated with a perisinusoidal fibrosis, after drug withdrawal. Moreover, there was significantly decreased venular wall cellularity in ex-DA (wall surface/mesenchymal cells = 949 +/- 158 in ex-DA; 622 +/- 40 in DA; 619 +/- 61 in PTCAH; 547 +/- 23 in CONTROL--P less than 0.001). Semiquantitative and morphometric data suggest that these vascular lesions and their reversibility may be due to the direct hepatotoxic effects of heroin.""",1

7894,7894,3154674,The pharmacology of nisoldipine,"Nisoldipine is a calcium antagonist that specifically blocks the slow or voltage-dependent calcium channel up to the highest concentrations. This mode of action has been confirmed in pharmacological studies on isolated organs, electrophysiological and binding studies, and by the measurement of transmembrane calcium transport. As with other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, an interaction with intracellular calcium reservoirs and calmodulin seems to be of minor importance. The drug exhibits higher potency, longer duration of action, and a higher binding affinity in vitro and in vivo than nifedipine. In contrast to its vasodilating and spasmolytic activity, its negative inotropic effect occurs in vitro only after higher concentrations than after nifedipine. In whole animals a secondary positive inotropic effect occurs regularly owing to sympathetic counter-regulation. The influence of nisoldipine on cardiac stimulus formation and conduction is also very slight in anesthetized animals, and is completely eliminated in awake animals and humans by counter-regulation up to very high doses. The cardiac anti-ischemic action of nisoldipine has been demonstrated in various ischemia models and is probably based predominantly on its afterload-reducing properties in addition to its spasmolytic effect on the coronary arteries. Various other suspected effects, for which there are isolated indications, e.g., inhibition of thromboxane synthesis, preload reduction, interaction with the transport of adenosine, and normalization of the sarcolemmal Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity, are probably of subordinate importance. Its antihypertensive effect is explained primarily by lowering of the peripheral resistance. There are, however, some indications that nisoldipine exerts certain effects over and above pure vasodilation. The prevention of postischemic calcium overloading in the renal tubule epithelium and the natriuretic effect are probably of importance in the therapeutic action. Clinically, nisoldipine was found more potent and prolonged in its action in comparison with nifedipine. In comparative studies, nisoldipine, 10 mg once a day, was found equieffective with nifedipine 10 mg three times or 20 mg twice a day in angina or hypertension, respectively.",1

We investigated the frequency and ethnic distribution of nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to deficiencies of 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-steroid dehydrogenase, 21-hydroxylase, or 11 beta-hydroxylase among 170 Israeli Jewish women with these clinical problems. All enzyme defects were identified by comparing the patients' hormonal responses to a 0.25-mg intravenous bolus dose of alpha 1-24-ACTH with those of 26 age-matched normal women. RESULTS: Twenty women (12 percent) had 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-steroid dehydrogenase deficiency, 18 (10 percent) 21-hydroxylase deficiency (14 homozygous), and 14 (8 percent) 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency. All the homozygous women with 21-hydroxylase deficiency also had evidence of a partial deficiency in 11 beta-hydroxylase activity. Similarly, most of the women with 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency also had evidence of a deficiency in 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-steroid dehydrogenase. Among the 118 women with no adrenal biosynthetic defect, 38 had high plasma androgen concentrations, and 80 had normal concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: About one third of Israeli Jewish women with hirsutism, menstrual disorders, or unexplained infertility had nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Secondary adrenal biosynthetic defects were frequent in these women and were probably caused by intra-adrenal androgen excess rather than by dual inherited enzymatic deficiencies.",0

6459,6459,29776950,Clinical effects and safety of electroacupuncture for the treatment of post-stroke depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials,"The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy/effectiveness and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) in the treatment of post-stroke depression (PSD). A comprehensive literature search in the Pubmed, Embase, CENTRAL, ISI Web of Science, CNKI and Wanfang databases was conducted, and all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool and Jadad score were used to assess the risk of bias of included studies, and only RCTs scoring ≥3 were included in a meta-analysis. 18 RCTs involving a total of 813 participants (mean age 61.6 years) in the EA groups and 723 participants (mean age 61.9 years) in the control groups were included. The included studies had an average 3 point Jadad score. PSD was diagnosed according to the Chinese Classification of Cerebrovascular Disease (CCCD) and the Chinese Classification of Mental Disease (CCMD) criteria. There was no significant difference between EA and antidepressants (fluoxetine 10-40 mg/day, citalopram 20 mg/day, sertraline 50 mg/day) in terms of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores at week 4 after treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.11, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.10), at week 6 after treatment (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.51) or at week 8 after treatment (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.22). However, the combined incidence of adverse events in the EA groups was significantly lower than in the antidepressant groups (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.33). There was no significant difference between EA and antidepressants in the severity of depression, however EA caused fewer adverse events than antidepressants. Additional larger scale RCTs with rigorous study design are required. ",0
