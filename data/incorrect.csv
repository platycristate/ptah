PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled study. Patients >�18�years of age presenting to the outpatient urology clinic with uncomplicated radio-opaque stones located in the distal third of the ureter and of size ?�10�mm were included. Patients were randomly assigned to either a control group (n=26) and received standard of care management (daily oral hydration and diclofenac 75�mg IM on demand) or to the alfuzosin group (n=28) and received alfuzosin SR 5�mg twice daily in addition to standard of care management. Patients were followed weekly at office visits and twice weekly by telephone for 4�weeks or until stone expulsion. Assessments included stone passage rate and time, and patients were monitored for occurrence of adverse drug events, complications, number of pain episodes, analgesic consumption, and number of hospital revisits. Mann-Whitney, ?(2) , and Fisher exact test were used for data analysis. RESULTS: All 54 patients completed the study. Stone expulsion rate was higher in the alfuzosin arm (53.6%, 15/28) compared to the control arm (26.9%, 7/26, p=0.04). Median stone passage time was lower in the alfuzosin group than in the control group (9 vs 19�days, respectively, p=0.006). Ureteral sepsis, uncontrollable pain, and hospitalization readmissions were reported in the control group only. There were no differences between groups in number of pain episodes, pain scores, or analgesic consumption. Alfuzosin therapy was tolerable with only minor adverse effects (headache, dizziness, mild postural hypotension, and rhinitis). CONCLUSION: Alfuzosin is safe and effective in increasing stone expulsion rates and shortening stone passage times for uncomplicated distal ureteral stones.",1
12801,12801,22782458,4-aminopyridine toxicity: a case report and review of the literature,"INTRODUCTION: 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) selectively blocks voltage-gated potassium channels, prolongs the action potential, increases calcium influx, and subsequently, enhances interneuronal and neuromuscular synaptic transmission. This medication has been studied and used in many disease processes hallmarked by poor neuronal transmission in both the central and peripheral nervous systems including: multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injuries (SCI), botulism, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. It has also been postulated as a potential treatment of verapamil toxicity and reversal agent for anesthesia-induced neuromuscular blockade. To date, there have been limited reports of either intentional or accidental 4-AP toxicity in humans. Both a case of a patient with 4-AP toxicity and review of the literature are discussed, highlighting commonalities observed in overdose. CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old man with progressive MS presented with diaphoresis, delirium, agitation, and choreathetoid movements after a presumed 4-AP overdose. 4-AP concentration at 6 h was 140 ng/mL. With aggressive benzodiazepine administration and intubation, he recovered uneventfully. DISCUSSION: The commonalities associated with 4-AP toxicity conforms to what is known about its mechanism of action combining cholinergic features including diaphoresis, altered mental status, and seizures with dopamine-related movement abnormalities including tremor, choreoathetosis, and dystonia. Management of patients poisoned by 4-AP centers around good supportive care with definitive airway management and controlling CNS hyperexcitability aggressively with gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist agents. Adjunctive use of dopamine antagonists for extrapyramidal effects after sedation is a treatment possibility. As 4-aminopyridine recently received Federal Drug Administration approval for the treatment of ambulation in patients with MS, physicians should be keenly aware of its presentation, mechanism of action, and management in overdose.",1
12016,12016,20074411,Outcomes and safety of concomitant nevirapine and rifampicin treatment under programme conditions in Malawi,"SETTING: Thyolo District Hospital, rural Malawi. OBJECTIVES: To report on 1) clinical, immunological and virological outcomes and 2) safety among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients with tuberculosis (TB) who received concurrent nevirapine (NVP) and rifampicin (RMP) based treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Analysis of programme data, June-December 2007. RESULTS: Of a total of 156 HIV-infected TB patients who started NVP-based antiretroviral treatment, 136 (87%) completed TB treatment successfully, 16 (10%) died and 5 (4%) were transferred out. Mean body weight and CD4 gain (adults) were respectively 4.4 kg (95%CI 3.3-5.4) and 140 cells/mm(3) (95%CI 117-162). Seventy-four per cent of patients who completed TB treatment and had a viral load performed (n = 74) had undetectable levels (<50 copies/ml), while 17 (22%) had a viral load of 50-1000 copies/ml. Hepatotoxicity was present in 2 (1.3%) patients at baseline. Two patients developed Grade 2 and one developed Grade 3 alanine transaminase enzyme elevations during TB treatment (incidence rate per 10 years of follow-up 4.2, 95%CI 1.4-13.1). There were no reported deaths linked to hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: In a rural district in Malawi, concomitant NVP and RMP treatment is associated with good TB treatment outcomes and appears safe. Further follow-up of patients would be useful to ascertain the longer-term effects of this concurrent treatment.",1

2245,2245,10383010,Low levels of dehydroascorbic acid in uraemic serum and the partial correction of dehydroascorbic acid deficiency by haemodialysis,"Vitamin C is currently considered a potent water-soluble antioxidant and it appeared reasonable to study the metabolic changes of vitamin C in uraemia and during haemodialysis. We measured the levels of ascorbic, dehydroascorbic and diketogulonic acids in sera of uraemic patients before and during haemodialysis, using the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine method. The results indicate that the levels of ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acids in uraemic sera are low in comparison with controls, but the levels of diketogulonic acid are higher than in healthy persons. The comparison of ratios between levels of these substances in uraemic sera and in normal sera indicate that the oxidation of ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic in uraemia proceeds much slower than in controls. We propose that uraemic patients are characterized by pronounced deficiency of dehydroascorbic acid. A marked decrease of ascorbic and diketogulonic acid plasma levels, and a pronounced increase of dehydroascorbic acid levels during haemodialysis was observed. Ratios between plasma levels of ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acids following haemodialysis are the same as in healthy persons. Uraemic patients are characterized by marked deficiency of dehydroascorbic acid and this deficiency can be partially corrected by haemodialysis. ",0
4108,4108,20512985,Multiple effects of silymarin on the hepatitis C virus lifecycle,"Silymarin, an extract from milk thistle (Silybum marianum), and its purified flavonolignans have been recently shown to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, both in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, we further characterized silymarin's antiviral actions. Silymarin had antiviral effects against hepatitis C virus cell culture (HCVcc) infection that included inhibition of virus entry, RNA and protein expression, and infectious virus production. Silymarin did not block HCVcc binding to cells but inhibited the entry of several viral pseudoparticles (pp), and fusion of HCVpp with liposomes. Silymarin but not silibinin inhibited genotype 2a NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity at concentrations 5 to 10 times higher than required for anti-HCVcc effects. Furthermore, silymarin had inefficient activity on the genotype 1b BK and four 1b RDRPs derived from HCV-infected patients. Moreover, silymarin did not inhibit HCV replication in five independent genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a replicon cell lines that did not produce infectious virus. Silymarin inhibited microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity, apolipoprotein B secretion, and infectious virion production into culture supernatants. Silymarin also blocked cell-to-cell spread of virus. CONCLUSION: Although inhibition of in vitro NS5B polymerase activity is demonstrable, the mechanisms of silymarin's antiviral action appear to include blocking of virus entry and transmission, possibly by targeting the host cell.",0

11099,11099,16887497,Effects of chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid on cholesterol absorption and metabolism in humans,"Quantitative and qualitative differences in intralumenal bile acids may affect cholesterol absorption and metabolism. To test this hypothesis, 2 cross-over outpatient studies were conducted in adults with apo-A IV 1/1 or apo-E 3/3 genotypes. Study 1 included 11 subjects 24 to 37 years of age, taking 15 mg/kg/day chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or no bile acid for 20 days while being fed a controlled diet. Study 2 included 9 adults 25 to 38 years of age, taking 15 mg/kg/day deoxycholic acid (DCA) or no bile acid, following the same experimental design and procedures as study 1. CDCA had no effect on plasma lipid concentrations, whereas DCA decreased (P < 0.05) plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and tended to decrease (P = 0.15) low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. CDCA treatment enriched (P < 0.0001) bile with CDCA and increased cholesterol concentration in micelles, whereas meal-stimulated bile acid concentrations were decreased. DCA treatment enriched (P < 0.0001) bile with DCA and tended to increase intralumenal cholesterol solubilized in micelles (P = 0.06). No changes were found in cholesterol absorption, free cholesterol fractional synthetic rate (FSR), or 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase and LDL receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels after CDCA treatment. DCA supplementation tended to decrease cholesterol absorption and reciprocally increase FSR and HMG CoA reductase and LDL receptor mRNA levels. Results of these 2 studies suggest that the solubilization of cholesterol in the intestinal micelles is not a rate-limiting step for its absorption.",1
7857,7857,3026019,Sulbactam plus ampicillin: interim review of efficacy and safety for therapeutic and prophylactic use,"""The efficacy and safety of sulbactam/ampicillin has been evaluated in 39 studies of therapeutic use and six studies of prophylaxis. Studies of therapy were conducted in 899 patients: 751 seriously ill, many of whom had multiple concurrent diseases, and 148 with gonorrhea. Overall clinical and bacteriologic success was achieved in 92% of assessable cases; 88% of 768 pathogens in these patients were eradicated. Of these pathogens, 43% were resistant to ampicillin; eradication rates of 91% and 85% were achieved in ampicillin-resistant and ampicillin-sensitive organisms, respectively. In 388 patients who received prophylactic sulbactam/ampicillin, efficacy was similar to that of comparative agents and better than that of a placebo in preventing wound infections after appendiceal, biliary, upper-gastrointestinal, or gynecologic surgery. Adverse reactions were infrequent with the exception of injection-site pain, which occurred mainly after intramuscular injection and was reduced in incidence by concurrent administration of lidocaine.""",1
2583,2583,12594313,Addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to standard chemotherapy for Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone,"BACKGROUND: Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone are closely related, highly malignant tumors of children, adolescents, and young adults. A new drug combination, ifosfamide and etoposide, was highly effective in patients with Ewing's sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone who had a relapse after standard therapy. We designed a study to test whether the addition of these drugs to a standard regimen would improve the survival of patients with newly diagnosed disease. METHODS: Patients 30 years old or younger with Ewing's sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone, or primitive sarcoma of bone were eligible. The patients were randomly assigned to receive 49 weeks of standard chemotherapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and dactinomycin or experimental therapy with these four drugs alternating with courses of ifosfamide and etoposide. RESULTS: A total of 518 patients met the eligibility requirements. Of 120 patients with metastatic disease, 62 were randomly assigned to the standard-therapy group and 58 to the experimental-therapy group. There was no significant difference in five-year event-free survival between the treatment groups (P=0.81). Among the 398 patients with nonmetastatic disease, the mean (+/-SE) five-year event-free survival among the 198 patients in the experimental-therapy group was 69+/-3 percent, as compared with 54+/-4 percent among the 200 patients in the standard-therapy group (P=0.005). Overall survival was also significantly better among patients in the experimental-therapy group (72+/-3.4 percent vs. 61+/-3.6 percent in the standard-therapy group, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to a standard regimen does not affect the outcome for patients with metastatic disease, but it significantly improves the outcome for patients with nonmetastatic Ewing's sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone, or primitive sarcoma of bone.",0
7552,7552,1974701,Brain tissue elasticity and CSF elastance,"In the analysis of the pressure-volume relationship of the intracranial system, the concept of brain elastance, sometimes called tissue elastance or CSF elastance, is often used. It is generally designated as Ecsf and is calculated as the slope of the pressure-volume curve of the system. Variations in Ecsf are related to, for example, changes in the buffering capacity of the system which, however, could be influenced by the cerebral vascular volume, compressibility of the meningeal membranes, and compressibility of the subpial brain tissue. Our interest is in isolating the effect of controlled changes in the intracranial system with changes in the subpial tissue only. Here we discuss the measurement of brain tissue elasticity and describe two experimental conditions in which simultaneous measurements showed distinct differences between the behaviour of the system CSF elastance and brain tissue elastic behaviour.",1
10614,10614,15114087,Preliminary experience with alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) and low-dose tacrolimus immunosuppression in adult liver transplantation,"""BACKGROUND: The administration of alemtuzumab (Campath-1H [C1H]; Berlex Laboratories, Montville, NJ) at transplantation prevents a vigorous immune response and is believed to allow a gradual engagement of the host immune system. We report our preliminary experience with C1H and tacrolimus (Tac) immunosuppression in adult liver transplantation. METHODS: We administered C1H and low-dose Tac to 40 adult recipients of cadaveric liver allografts between December 2001 and April 2003. A control group who met the same eligibility criteria consisted of 50 liver transplant recipients treated with our standard Tac and steroids protocol. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics and patient and graft survival were similar (P >0.15). The incidence of acute rejection was significantly lower during the first 2 months posttransplantation (P =0.002) and slightly lower overall in the study group versus the control group at 12 months (46% vs. 55%, P =0.12, log-rank test). Median time to rejection among those experiencing rejection was significantly longer in the study group versus control group (2.76 vs. 0.34 months, P =0.0007). The mean Tac dose, 12-hr trough level, and percentage of patients receiving maintenance steroids were significantly lower in the group receiving C1H and Tac (P <0.0001 during the first 3 months, P <0.05 thereafter), as were the mean creatinine levels (P <0.05) and incidence of nephrotoxicity (P =0.004, conversion from Tac to other agents). Finally, in the group receiving C1H/Tac, patients with an average Tac trough level less than 6.5 ng/mL during the first 2 months post-transplantation demonstrated a significantly higher rejection rate beyond that time (P =0.02). CONCLUSION: C1H and low-dose Tac seems to be at least as effective as our standard Tac and steroids regimen in preventing acute rejection in adult liver allotransplantation with less renal toxicity and less use of maintenance steroids.""",1
11089,11089,16854576,Hepatotoxicity potential of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) in rats,"""Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens L.) is an herbal drug used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). There has been a report that a preparation containing this herb has caused cholestatic hepatitis in one person and some indications exist that it may have the potential to produce liver toxicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of saw palmetto on rat liver function by measuring its effects on several enzymes and formation of malondialdehyde (MDA), a byproduct of lipid peroxidation. A significant increase in these parameters is considered an indication of liver toxicity. Thirty-six rats were divided into 6 groups of 6 animals each. They were treated for 2 or 4 weeks with a placebo or saw palmetto at doses of 9.14 or 22.86 mg/kg/body wt./day; that is, 2 x and 5 x the maximum recommended daily human dosages. After 2 or 4 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and blood was collected to prepare serum for enzyme assays, which were performed using commercially available kits. A portion of the liver was removed, and a homogenate prepared for the lipid peroxidation assay. Results showed no significant difference in animal body weight, enzyme activity, or MDA formation at either time or dosage level, as compared to controls. The data indicate that at the doses and time periods tested, saw palmetto did not produce any significant effect on the normal biological markers of liver toxicity.""",1
2910,2910,15241437,BCR-ABL transcripts are early predictors for hematological relapse in chronic myeloid leukemia after hematopoietic cell transplantation with reduced intensity conditioning,"Kinetics of BCR-ABL transcript elimination and its prognostic implications on relapse were analyzed in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after reduced intensity hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In all, 19 CML patients were conditioned with 2 Gy total-body irradiation in combination with (n=14) or without (n=3) fludarabine 3 x 30 mg/m(2) (Flu) or 4.5 Gy total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) with Flu and OKT3 3 x 5 mg (n=2) and were treated with cyclosporine (CSP) and mycophenolate mofetil after allogeneic HCT. BCR-ABL transcripts were analyzed by nested RT-PCR and Taqman((R)) RT-PCR on days +28, +56 and +84 after HCT and were evaluated for their association with relapse. Of the 19 patients, 14 achieved sustained remissions of which six had a negative RT-PCR 28 days after HCT. Five patients relapsed +41, +54, +57, +136 and +234 days after HCT. Predictors for relapse were advanced disease stage (P=0.02) and slow reduction of BCR-ABL transcripts at day 28 (P=0.006) and day 56 (P=0.047) post-transplant. We conclude that a complete clearance of BCR-ABL transcripts is achievable within 4 weeks from HCT even after minimal conditioning and that early kinetics of BCR-ABL transcripts significantly correlate with the probability of hematological relapse.

9156,9156,8604150,"Comparative studies on the toxicity of mercury, cadmium, and copper toward the isolated perfused rat liver","""The toxic effects of cadmium, mercury, and copper were compared over the over range 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mM using the isolated perfused rat liver preparation. All metals caused similar changes in various parameters used to describe general toxicity. Thus reductions in oxygen consumption, perfusion flow, and biliary secretion were found, while lactate dehydrogenase release into the perfusate, as well as liver weight, increased also in a dose-dependent fashion. Each metal caused similar magnitudes of changes and exerted similar potency. Measurement of other parameters indicating more specific injury revealed a number of differences. Although all metals reduced hepatic ATP concentration, mercury and cadmium were more potent than copper in this respect. Cadmium was the most potent at decreasing reduced glutathione levels. Mercury was most effective at increasing tissue calcium content, while copper was less so, and cadmium ineffective. Only copper significantly increased tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) content, while all metals increased its release into perfusate. Furthermore, whereas cadmium seemed the most potent metal in increasing MDA release, it was least efficacious, while copper was the most. Antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and Trolox C only reduced cadmium's influence on MDA in perfusate; however, they did not affect cadmium's ability to alter most other parameters of vitality. Albumin reversed the toxic effects of copper and mercury, but not cadmium. While metal-induced reductions in perfusion flow accounted for some of the toxic effects of the metals investigated, the results as a whole supported the suggestion that all metals exerted toxicity at the mitochondria, since ATP levels were reduced in a manner that could not be reproduced by perfusion flow reduction alone. Lipid peroxidation appears to play little role in determining toxicity induced by any of these metals. Furthermore, albumin may play an important physiological role in preventing hepatic injury that might otherwise be induced through acute metal intoxication.""",1
9205,9205,8764622,Isoniazid-related fatal hepatitis,"To describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of fatal hepatitis due to single-drug isoniazid preventive therapy for tuberculosis, we did a survey of cases from state health departments, published case reports, and reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1970 to 1992. Of 108 reported cases, some clinical information was available for 76. A medical review panel judged 39 of these deaths as probably due to isoniazid hepatitis and 23 deaths as possibly due to isoniazid hepatitis. Of the 62 probable and possible cases combined, 50 (81%) were female, 49 (79%) were non-Hispanic black or Hispanic, and 19 (31%) were younger than 35 years. The median duration of isoniazid preventive therapy before symptom onset was 16 weeks. Of the 60 cases with symptom information, 54 (90%) presented with jaundice. Of the 62 cases, 26 (42%) were monitored monthly in accordance with current recommendations, and 6 of the patients were younger than 35 years. We estimate that the rate of fatal isoniazid hepatitis among patients in the public sector was no greater than 4.2 per 100,000 persons beginning therapy and no greater than 7 per 100,000 persons completing therapy. Adherence to isoniazid preventive therapy guidelines apparently reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of fatal hepatitis. Careful patient selection, education, and monitoring are critical for minimizing that risk.",1

12154,12154,20574538,"A randomised trial to compare the safety, tolerability and efficacy of three drug combinations for intermittent preventive treatment in children","BACKGROUND: Results from trials of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) in infants and children have shown that IPT provides significant protection against clinical malaria. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) given alone or in combination with other drugs has been used for most IPT programmes. However, SP resistance is increasing in many parts of Africa. Thus, we have investigated whether SP plus AQ, SP plus piperaquine (PQ) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) plus PQ might be equally safe and effective when used for IPT in children in an area of seasonal transmission. METHODS: During the 2007 malaria transmission season, 1008 Gambian children were individually randomized to receive SP plus amodiaquine (AQ), SP plus piperaquine (PQ) or dihydroartemisinin (DHA) plus PQ at monthly intervals on three occasions during the peak malaria transmission season. To determine the risk of side effects following drug administration, participants in each treatment group were visited at home three days after the start of each round of drug administration and a side effects questionnaire completed. To help establish whether adverse events were drug related, the same questionnaire was administered to 286 age matched control children recruited from adjacent villages. Morbidity was monitored throughout the malaria transmission season and study children were seen at the end of the malaria transmission season. RESULTS: All three treatment regimens showed good safety profiles. No severe adverse event related to IPT was reported. The most frequent adverse events reported were coughing, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. Cough was present in 15.2%, 15.4% and 18.7% of study subjects who received SP plus AQ, DHA plus PQ or SP plus PQ respectively, compared to 19.2% in a control group. The incidence of malaria in the DHA plus PQ, SP plus AQ and SP plus PQ groups were 0.10 cases per child year (95% CI: 0.05, 0.22), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.022, 0.16) and 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.15) respectively.

5741,5741,25692915,"Aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab for diabetic macular edema","BACKGROUND: The relative efficacy and safety of intravitreous aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab in the treatment of diabetic macular edema are unknown. METHODS: At 89 clinical sites, we randomly assigned 660 adults (mean age, 61�10 years) with diabetic macular edema involving the macular center to receive intravitreous aflibercept at a dose of 2.0 mg (224 participants), bevacizumab at a dose of 1.25 mg (218 participants), or ranibizumab at a dose of 0.3 mg (218 participants). The study drugs were administered as often as every 4 weeks, according to a protocol-specified algorithm. The primary outcome was the mean change in visual acuity at 1 year. RESULTS: From baseline to 1 year, the mean visual-acuity letter score (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better visual acuity; a score of 85 is approximately 20/20) improved by 13.3 with aflibercept, by 9.7 with bevacizumab, and by 11.2 with ranibizumab. Although the improvement was greater with aflibercept than with the other two drugs (P<0.001 for aflibercept vs. bevacizumab and P=0.03 for aflibercept vs. ranibizumab), it was not clinically meaningful, because the difference was driven by the eyes with worse visual acuity at baseline (P<0.001 for interaction). When the initial visual-acuity letter score was 78 to 69 (equivalent to approximately 20/32 to 20/40) (51% of participants), the mean improvement was 8.0 with aflibercept, 7.5 with bevacizumab, and 8.3 with ranibizumab (P>0.50 for each pairwise comparison). When the initial letter score was less than 69 (approximately 20/50 or worse), the mean improvement was 18.9 with aflibercept, 11.8 with bevacizumab, and 14.2 with ranibizumab (P<0.001 for aflibercept vs. bevacizumab, P=0.003 for aflibercept vs. ranibizumab, and P=0.21 for ranibizumab vs. bevacizumab). There were no significant differences among the study groups in the rates of serious adverse events (P=0.40), hospitalization (P=0.51), death (P=0.72), or major cardiovascular events (P=0.56). CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreous aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab improved vision in eyes with center-involved diabetic macular edema, but the relative effect depended on baseline visual acuity. When the initial visual-acuity loss was mild, there were no apparent differences, on average, among study groups. At worse levels of initial visual acuity, aflibercept was more effective at improving vision. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01627249.).",0

METHODS: We examined the long-term survival of all children and adolescents who were under 20 years of age when renal-replacement therapy commenced (study period, April 1963 through March 2002), using data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry. Survival was analyzed with the use of Kaplan-Meier methods and age-standardized mortality rates. Risk factors for death were analyzed with the use of Cox regression analysis with time-dependent covariates. RESULTS: A total of 1634 children and adolescents were followed for a median of 9.7 years. The long-term survival rate among children requiring renal-replacement therapy was 79 percent at 10 years and 66 percent at 20 years. Mortality rates were 30 times as high as for children without end-stage renal disease. Risk factors for death were a young age at the time renal-replacement therapy was initiated (especially for children under 1 year of age, among whom the risk was four times as high as for children 15 to 19 years of age) and treatment with dialysis (which was associated with a risk more than four times as high as for renal transplantation). Overall, a trend toward improved survival was observed over the four decades of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvement in long-term survival, mortality rates among children requiring renal-replacement therapy remain substantially higher than those among children without end-stage renal disease. Increasing the proportion of children treated with renal transplantation rather than with dialysis can improve survival further.",0

A total of 85 actinic keratoses in 53 patients were treated, initially with four applications per week for the first week. After this first week, if intolerable irritation arose, patients were instructed to reduce application frequency to two times per week for the rest of the treatment period. Treatment was completed for 95.4% of the lesions included, with healing of 88.6% of them. The mean time to healing was 7.4 weeks (with four applications weekly) and 10.2 weeks (with two applications). The healing rate was similar in the two groups. Significant correlations (p<0.001) were observed between application frequency and time to healing. Intermittent 5-fluorouracil treatment is effective without causing significant irritation, but time to healing increases with declining application frequency. ",0
2186,2186,10373070,Incidence and outcome of Clostridium difficile infection following autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation,"A retrospective evaluation of 200 consecutive recipients of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) was conducted to ascertain the incidence and outcome of infection with Clostridium difficile. The diagnosis was confirmed in 14 patients with diarrhea (15 episodes) at a median of 33 days after stem cell infusion. Five patients were neutropenic at the time of diagnosis. Every individual had adverse known risk factors such as recent or current use of antibiotic, corticosteroid and antiviral therapy, recent administration of myeloablative chemotherapy and numerous, prolonged periods of hospitalization. Diarrhea, frequently hemorrhagic, was the most common presenting feature along with fever, abdominal cramps and abdominal distention. Diagnosis was established by the stool-cytotoxin test. Response to standard treatment with oral vancomycin or metronidazole was prompt despite the presence of several adverse prognostic features in these patients. There was only one instance of relapse which was also treated successfully. Several transplant-related variables such as age, sex, underlying malignancy, myelo-ablative regimen, duration of neutropenia, and prophylactic use of oral ampicillin underwent statistical analysis but failed to be predictive of C. difficile infection in such a setting. Finally, C. difficile is not uncommon after autologous PBSCT and must be included in the differential diagnosis in any such patient with diarrhea. ",0
622,622,1984193,An epidemiologic study of abuse of analgesic drugs. Effects of phenacetin and salicylate on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity (1968 to 1987),"BACKGROUND: Phenacetin abuse is known to produce kidney disease; salicylate use is supposed to prevent cardiovascular disease. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal epidemiologic study to examine the effects of these drugs on cause-specific mortality and on cardiovascular morbidity. METHODS: In 1968 we evaluated a study group of 623 healthy women 30 to 49 years old who had evidence of a regular intake of phenacetin, as measured by urinary excretion of its metabolites, and a matched control group of 621 women. Salicylate excretion was also measured. All subjects were examined over a period of 20 years. RESULTS: Life-table analyses of mortality during the 20 years, with adjustment for the year of birth, cigarette smoking, and length of follow-up, revealed significant differences between the groups in overall mortality (study group vs. control group, 74 vs. 27 deaths; relative risk, 2.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.3), deaths due to urologic or renal disease (relative risk, 16.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.9 to 66.1), deaths due to cancer (relative risk, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.3), and deaths due to cardiovascular disease (relative risk, 2.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 5.5). The relative risk of cardiovascular disease (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke) was 1.8, and the 95 percent confidence interval 1.3 to 2.6. The odds ratio for the incidence of hypertension was 1.6, and the 95 percent confidence interval 1.2 to 2.1. The effects of phenacetin on morbidity and mortality, with adjustment for base-line salicylate excretion, were similar. In contrast, salicylate use had no effect on either mortality or morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Regular use of analgesic drugs containing phenacetin is associated with an increased risk of hypertension and mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular disease, as well as an increased risk of mortality due to cancer and urologic or renal disease. The use of salicylates carries no such risk.",0
2772,2772,15070126,Oligodendroglioma and juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma presenting as synchronous primary brain tumors. Case report with histological and molecular differentiation of the tumors and review of the literature,"Multiple metastatic brain tumors and multifocal primary brain tumors of a single histological type are well described in the literature. The concurrent presence of multiple primary brain tumors with different histological characteristics, however, is very rare. The authors describe the first known case in which an oligodendroglioma and a juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA) presented as synchronous primary brain tumors in the same patient. This 43-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of progressive headaches, nausea, and vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an enhancing heterogeneous right medial cerebellar lesion and a larger calcified, nonenhancing, heterogeneous right frontal lesion with surrounding edema and a mass effect. The results of a metastatic workup were unremarkable. The patient underwent an initial right frontotemporal craniotomy and a subsequent suboccipital craniectomy 2 years later for resection of the posterior fossa lesion. Histological examination revealed the frontal and cerebellar lesions to be an oligodendroglioma and JPA, respectively. A molecular analysis detected a deletion of chromosome 1p36 in the oligodendroglioma, but not in the JPA. After the initial operation, the patient received follow-up care for his oligodendroglioma, but eventually required temozolomide for tumor progression. His condition remains stable both neurologically and according to imaging studies. The authors describe the first known case in which a low-grade oligodendroglioma and a JPA presented as synchronous primary brain tumors. They review the literature on multiple primary brain tumors with different histological characteristics and discuss potential mechanisms for the development of these lesions. ",0
9168,9168,8637535,The effects of supraphysiologic doses of testosterone on muscle size and strength in normal men,"""BACKGROUND: Athletes often take androgenic steroids in an attempt to increase their strength. The efficacy of these substances for this purpose is unsubstantiated, however. METHODS: We randomly assigned 43 normal men to one of four groups: placebo with no exercise; testosterone with no exercise; placebo plus exercise; and testosterone plus exercise. The men received injections of 600 mg of testosterone enanthate or placebo weekly for 10 weeks. The men in the exercise groups performed standardized weight-lifting exercises three times weekly. Before and after the treatment period, fat-free mass was determined by underwater weighing, muscle size was measured by magnetic resonance imaging, and the strength of the arms and legs was assessed by bench-press and squatting exercises, respectively. RESULTS: Among the men in the no-exercise groups, those given testosterone had greater increases than those given placebo in muscle size in their arms (mean [+/-SE] change in triceps area, 424 +/- 104 vs. -81 +/- 109 square millimeters; P < 0.05) and legs (change in quadriceps area, 607 +/- 123 vs. -131 +/- 111 square millimeters; P < 0.05) and greater increases in strength in the bench-press (9 +/- 4 vs. -1 +/- 1 kg, P < 0.05) and squatting exercises (16 +/- 4 vs. 3 +/- 1 kg, P < 0.05). The men assigned to testosterone and exercise had greater increases in fat-free mass (6.1 +/- 0.6 kg) and muscle size (triceps area, 501 +/- 104 square millimeters; quadriceps area, 1174 +/- 91 square millimeters) than those assigned to either no-exercise group, and greater increases in muscle strength (bench-press strength, 22 +/- 2 kg; squatting-exercise capacity, 38 +/- 4 kg) than either no-exercise group. Neither mood nor behavior was altered in any group. CONCLUSIONS: Supraphysiologic doses of testosterone, especially when combined with strength training, increase fat-free mass and muscle size and strength in normal men.""",1
8623,8623,6672506,The liver in fatal exertional heatstroke,"We describe the chronology of hepatic histopathologic alterations in 50 cases of fatal exertional heatstroke related to military training. Five patients who died in the field demonstrated the earliest alterations: fatty change (sometimes microvacuolar), amitotic hepatocellular regeneration, accumulation of hemosiderin, and congestion. In addition, the sinusoids contained polymorphonuclear leukocytes, immature erythroid and granulocytic cells, megakaryocytes, and lymphocytes. Fibrin was not evident. The other 45 patients, who survived up to 8 days following hospitalization, also demonstrated these findings. Microvacuolar fatty change was common in this group of patients, and degenerated hepatocytes resembled Councilman bodies. Coagulative degeneration and submassive necrosis were uncommon. Of those surviving over 12 h, more than half had bile stasis (sometimes ductal), frequently associated with acute cholangitis and ductular proliferation. Regeneration and pigmentary alterations have not been recognized as early hepatic findings in heatstroke, nor have intrasinusoidal bone marrow elements, ductal bile stasis, and acute cholangitis been described. Possible pathogenic factors, other than hyperthermia and sequellae of shock, include obesity, recent illnesses and immunizations, bacterial toxemia, hemolysis, and bone marrow injury.",1

The study medication was administered as 1 nitazoxanide 500-mg tablet or a matching placebo twice daily for 3 days. Thirty-eight (81%) of 47 patients in the nitazoxanide treatment group resolved diarrhea within 7 days (median, 3 days) after initiation of treatment, versus 17 (40%) of 42 in the placebo group (P=.0002). With its efficacy in treating a broad spectrum of enteric protozoan pathogens, nitazoxanide could play an important role in the management of diarrhea caused by enteric protozoa, reducing morbidity and costs associated with these diarrheal illnesses.",1
13104,13104,23596311,HLA haplotype determines hapten or p-i T cell reactivity to flucloxacillin,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a main cause of drug withdrawal. A particularly interesting example is flucloxacillin (FLUX)-DILI, which is associated with the HLA-B*57:01 allele. At present, the mechanism of FLUX-DILI is not understood, but the HLA association suggests a role for activated T cells in the pathomechanism of liver damage. To understand the interaction among FLUX, HLA molecules, and T cells, we generated FLUX-reacting T cells from FLUX-naive HLA-B*57:01(+) and HLA-B*57:01(-) healthy donors and investigated the mechanism of T cell stimulation. We found that FLUX stimulates CD8(+) T cells in two distinct manners. On one hand, FLUX was stably presented on various HLA molecules, resistant to extensive washing and dependent on proteasomal processing, suggesting a hapten mechanism. On the other hand, in HLA-B*57:01(+) individuals, we observed a pharmacological interaction with immune receptors (p-i)-based T cell reactivity. FLUX was presented in a labile manner that was further characterized by independence of proteasomal processing and immediate T cell clone activation upon stimulation with FLUX in solution. This p-i-based T cell stimulation was restricted to the HLA-B*57:01 allele. We conclude that the presence of HLA-B*57:01 drives CD8(+) T cell responses to the penicillin-derivative FLUX toward nonhapten mechanism.",1

2415,2415,11481622,Adult hepatitis B vaccination using a novel triple antigen recombinant vaccine,"Present hepatitis B vaccines use multidose prolonged regimens, which even healthcare workers at risk do not always complete. Moreover, when vaccination is completed there remain some who fail to achieve adequate protection. The protection of adults at risk could be improved if there were a more potent vaccine and/or a shorter vaccination regimen available. Vaccine-naive adults were randomized to vaccination with either Engerix-B (SmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) or a novel triple antigen (S, pre-S1, and pre-S2) recombinant vaccine (Hepacare; Medeva Pharma Plc, Speke, UK). The primary efficacy parameter was the degree of seroprotection 6 or 7 months (26 +/- 2 weeks) after beginning vaccination. A total of 304 adults entered the study. Of these, 16 failed to complete the study (9 on Hepacare and 7 on Engerix-B). With the Engerix-B standard (0, 1, 6) regimen, 88% of subjects were protected by month 7, whereas with the triple antigen vaccine a 2-dose regimen (0, 1) provided equivalent protection (91%) within 6 months and a 3-dose (0, 1, 6) regimen was significantly superior (98% seroprotected by 7 months after starting vaccination P <.001). With adults at risk for a suboptimal response (i.e., older adults, the obese, men, and smokers) the triple antigen vaccine produced a greater degree of protection. The vaccines had similar safety profiles. Both vaccines were well tolerated. In healthy normal adults, a triple antigen hepatitis B vaccine containing S and pre-S antigens produced an enhanced immunologic response and was as effective as a 2- and 3-dose regimen.",0
827,827,2816238,Displacement of warfarin from human serum proteins by halothane anaesthesia,"The in vitro effects of the halothane metabolite, trifluoroacetic acid, on the binding of warfarin to human serum proteins have been investigated. An increase in the percentage of free warfarin following incubation with different concentrations of trifluoroacetic acid (1 and 4 mmol/l) was observed. In addition, protein binding of warfarin was studied in serum from patients undergoing halothane anaesthesia (1-2.5%; 2.5 h). After 24 h from the end of the halothane anaesthesia, an increase in the percentage of free warfarin was also detected (0.92 +/- 0.06% at 24 h vs 0.60 +/- 0.02% before halothane administration; P less than 0.005). We conclude that halothane anaesthesia may temporarily potentiate the pharmacological effect of warfarin in the postoperative period following anaesthetic procedures. ",0
8086,8086,3934499,Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency--the effects of betaine treatment in pyridoxine-responsive patients,"""Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency may be responsive to pyridoxine, a precursor of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate, and the amount of residual enzyme activity present is the probable determinant of this. In six treated pyridoxine-responsive patients whose biochemical control of fasting plasma amino acid levels appeared optimal, we assessed the effects on plasma amino acids of standard oral methionine loads (4g/m2 of body area) before and after adding betaine (trimethylglycine) 6 g/d, to the treatment regimen of pyridoxine and folic acid. Our aim was to define the capacity of these patients to metabolize methionine and to determine whether betaine would effect a reduction in postload homocysteine levels. During the 24 hours after the methionine challenge all patients had higher plasma methionine and homocysteine and lower cysteine than did 17 normal subjects. After betaine these homocysteine responses were reduced to near normal, and there was a trend toward increased methionine. There was a direct correlation between premethionine fasting homocysteine and mean homocysteine responses during the 24 hours following the methionine load, both before (r = 0.79) and after betaine (r = 0.71). Betaine also increased plasma cysteine levels in patients with the more severe biochemical abnormalities. After betaine there were modest increases in plasma serine (mean increase 25%; P less than 0.025). Since the vascular complications of homocystinuria are related to increased plasma homocysteine, betaine therapy may reduce this risk in patients receiving a standard pyridoxine and folic acid regimen in whom there are abnormal homocysteine responses after a standard methionine load.""",1

14178,14178,28606562,The Efficacy and Safety of 3 Types of Interventions for Stroke Prevention in Patients With Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases: A Network Meta-analysis,"""PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to compare the relative efficacy and safety of different types of interventions for stroke prevention in patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. METHODS: This network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted with a random effects model of Bayesian framework using Stata version 12.0. Odds ratios (ORs) and their credible intervals (CrIs) were applied for the efficacy and safety evaluation of various medical interventions, including aspirin, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, warfarin, and apixaban. In addition, the ranking of probability of every clinical outcome was estimated by comparing the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. FINDINGS: Compared with dabigatran, both edoxaban and aspirin + warfarin exhibited a higher rate of all-cause stroke (OR, 2.84 [95% CrI, 1.17-6.97]; OR, 3.42 [95% CrI, 1.20-9.84]). With respect to intracranial hemorrhage, aspirin + clopidogrel yielded worse outcomes than 7 treatments, including placebo, apixaban, aspirin, aspirin + dipyridamole, cilostazol, clopidogrel, and dabigatran (OR, 2.21 [95% CrI, 1.45-3.40]; OR, 2.11 [95% CrI, 1.05-4.17]; OR, 1.53 [95% CrI, 1.11-2.15]; OR, 1.78 [95% CrI, 1.01-3.03]; OR, 4.17 [95% CrI, 1.37-14.28]; OR, 1.85 [95% CrI, 1.22-2.86]; and OR, 2.56 [95% CrI, 1.37-4.76]). In terms of ischemic stroke, dabigatran provided better efficacy than placebo, aspirin, and aspirin + dipyridamole (OR, 0.36 [95% CrI, 0.18-0.72]; OR, 0.43 [95% CrI, 0.21-0.84]; and OR, 0.41 [95% CrI, 0.17-0.94]). As for mortality, dabigatran resulted in a lower mortality compared with aspirin, aspirin + clopidogrel, edoxaban, and warfarin (OR, 0.48 [95% CrI, 0.23-0.97]; OR, 0.40 [95% CrI, 0.17-0.92]; OR, 0.27 [95% CrI, 0.10-0.72]; and OR, 0.52 [95% CrI, 0.28-0.92]). IMPLICATIONS: There are still some limitations to our NMA research. For instance, the lack of direct evidence for some therapies resulted in inconsistencies, particularly for warfarin compared with placebo and clopidogrel under different end points. Moreover, the included randomized controlled trials for patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are relatively broad, involving atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke. Although further research is needed, dabigatran is highly recommended based on the present NAM for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases due to the drug's efficacy and safety.""",1
4868,4868,24312465,Low body weight in females is a risk factor for increased tenofovir exposure and drug-related adverse events,"Treatment with tenofovir sometimes leads to non-reversible kidney and/or bone diseases. Factors associated with these drug-related adverse events are poorly characterized. Our objective was to investigate such factors in patients treated long term with daily tenofovir. One-hundred Caucasian HIV-positive patients with basal creatinine clearance >80 mL/min treated with tenofovir for at least 6 months and with at least one assessment of tenofovir plasma trough concentrations were considered. Tenofovir-associated adverse events were defined as the appearance of pathological proteinuria, worsening of renal function or bone demineralization. By multivariate regression analysis, we found that serum creatinine (p = 0.003) and body weight (p = 0.002) were the factors independently associated with plasma tenofovir concentrations. In particular, women with body weight<50 kg had significantly higher plasma tenofovir concentrations than those weighting >50 Kg (160±93 vs.71±52 ng/mL, p<0.001). High tenofovir plasma trough concentrations and the age of the patients were independently associated with the development of drug-related kidney and bone toxicity. In this retrospective study we have shown that HIV-infected women with low body weight are at risk to be exposed to high tenofovir plasma trough concentrations, ultimately resulting in a significant hazard to develop long-term tenofovir complications.

METHODS: In a prospective study we genotyped 89 patients treated with isoniazid (INH) for latent tuberculosis. INH-induced hepatitis (INH-H) or elevated liver enzymes including hepatitis (INH-ELE) was diagnosed based on the clinical diagnostic scale (CDS) designed for routine clinical practice. NAT2 genotypes were assessed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer probe after PCR analysis, and CYP2E1 genotypes were determined by PCR with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (29%) had INH-ELE, while eight (9%) presented with INH-H leading to INH treatment interruption. We report no significant influence of NAT2 polymorphism, but we did find a significant association between the CYP2E1 *1A/*1A genotype and INH-ELE (OR: 3.4; 95% CI:1.1-12; p = 0.02) and a non significant trend for INH-H (OR: 5.9; 95% CI: 0.69-270; p = 0.13) compared with other CYP2E1 genotypes. This test for predicting INH-ELE had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 39% (95% CI: 26-54%) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 84% (95% CI: 69-94%). CONCLUSION: The genotyping of CYP2E1 polymorphisms may be a useful predictive tool in the common setting of a highly heterogeneous population for predicting isoniazid-induced hepatic toxicity. Larger prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm these results.""",1
10029,10029,11825325,Sirolimus: a comprehensive review,"Sirolimus (Rapamune), Wyeth-Ayerst, Madison, NJ) is a new, potent, immunosuppressant that is emerging as a foundation for long-term immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation. The drug acts during both co-stimulatory activation and cytokine-driven pathways via a unique mechanism: inhibition of a multifunctional serine-threonine kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Although there is no a priori reason to assume it, sirolimus displays a synergistic interaction to enhance the efficacy of cyclosporin A (CsA). In trials wherein the concentrations of CsA and sirolimus were tightly controlled, rates of acute rejection episodes were < 10%, despite markedly reduced exposures to each agent. In pivotal multi-centre blinded dose-controlled trials, the rates of acute rejection episodes within 12 months following administration of 2 or 5 mg/day sirolimus in combination with CsA and steroids were reduced to 19 and 14%, respectively. Since the inhibitory effect of sirolimus disables virtually all responses to cytokine mediators due to the widespread involvement of mTOR in multiple signalling pathways, the agent is likely also to retard proliferation of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, an important component of the immuno-obliterative processes associated with chronic rejection. The advantages of this unique therapeutic action combined with an intrinsic lack of nephrotoxicity are counterbalanced by myelosuppressive and hyperlipidaemic side effects. Ongoing studies are assessing whether the long-term benefits of sirolimus to permit reduction in exposure to or elimination of calcineurin inhibitors ameliorate the progression of chronic nephropathy, the condition that erodes long-term renal transplant survival.",1
4086,4086,20169624,Specific human leukocyte antigen class I and II alleles associated with hepatitis C virus viremia,"Studies of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and their relation with hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremia have had conflicting results. However, these studies have varied in size and methods, and few large studies assessed HLA class I alleles. Only one study conducted high-resolution class I genotyping. The current investigation therefore involved high-resolution HLA class I and II genotyping of a large multiracial cohort of U.S. women with a high prevalence of HCV and HIV. Our primary analyses evaluated associations between 12 HLA alleles identified through a critical review of the literature and HCV viremia in 758 HCV-seropositive women. Other alleles with >5% prevalence were also assessed; previously unreported associations were corrected for multiple comparisons. DRB1*0101 (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-2.6), B*5701 (PR=2.0; 95% CI = 1.0-3.1), B*5703 (PR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.0-2.5), and Cw*0102 (PR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.0-3.0) were associated with the absence of HCV RNA (i.e., HCV clearance), whereas DRB1*0301 (PR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.2-0.7) was associated with HCV RNA positivity. DQB1*0301 was also associated with the absence of HCV RNA but only among HIV-seronegative women (PR = 3.4; 95% CI = 1.2-11.8). Each of these associations was among those predicted. We additionally studied the relation of HLA alleles with HCV infection (serostatus) in women at high risk of HCV from injection drug use (N = 838), but no significant relationships were observed. CONCLUSION: HLA genotype influences the host capacity to clear HCV viremia. The specific HLA associations observed in the current study are unlikely to be due to chance because they were a priori hypothesized.",0

An update based on clinical trial results,"""The safety of ciprofloxacin was established on a data base (compiled through the end of 1988) of 9,473 well-documented treatment courses world-wide. The daily dosages ranged between 200 and 2,000 mg orally. Thirty-eight percent of the patients received doses between 1 and 10 mg/kg body weight, 46 percent between 11 and 20 mg/kg, and the remaining 16 percent more than 20 mg/kg body weight daily. Ciprofloxacin was administered to 4,214 women (45 percent) and 5,252 men (55 percent). The duration of treatment ranged from less than two days to more than 90 days. A 600-mg daily dose of ciprofloxacin was used mostly in Japan (2,341 patients). The daily dose of 1,000 mg was administered chiefly in the United States and Europe (2,288 patients). The age of the patients ranged from less than one year to 99 years (mean, 50.6 years). More than 38 percent were older than 60 years. According to COSTART terminology, the following drug-related side effects were observed in the different organ systems: digestive, 4.9 percent; metabolic-nutritional, 4.4 percent; central nervous system, 1.5 percent, skin, 1.1 percent; hemic and lymphatic, 0.9 percent; urogenital, 0.8 percent; body as a whole, 0.5 percent; cardiovascular, 0.2 percent; special senses, 0.2 percent; musculoskeletal, 0.1 percent; and respiratory, 0.1 percent. Several patients had more than one reaction. The total incidence of side effects for the treated patients was 9.3 percent. The vast majority of adverse reactions were mild or moderate (94 percent). Serious side effects were reported for 55 patients (6 percent). Based on the 9,473 courses, the incidence of severe reactions was 0.6 percent. Ciprofloxacin treatment was discontinued due to side effects in 146 patients (1.5 percent), mostly due to gastrointestinal reactions (80 patients).

Twelve cases were treated for 12 months as they had meningitis (7), disseminated tuberculosis (2), or miliary tuberculosis (3). The results showed that none of the children, at the end of follow up, showed evidence of active tuberculosis. All children tolerated the drugs well, with side effects noticed being mild, namely transient hepatitis (4), vomiting (1), and skin rash (1). It is suggested that SCC for 6-9 months using isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin along with other drugs when necessary is highly effective in most cases of tuberculosis in children and has several advantages over conventional chemotherapy of 18 months or longer duration.",1

Sequence analysis of genes (cyp51A and cyp51B) encoding the 14alpha-sterol demethylases revealed that all five strains harbored mutations in cyp51A resulting in the replacement of methionine at residue 220 by valine, lysine, or threonine. When the mutated cyp51A genes were introduced into an A. fumigatus wild-type strain, the transformants exhibited reduced susceptibility to all triazole agents, confirming that the mutations were responsible for the resistance phenotype.

The Phase II TRILOGY-1 and TRILOGY-2 studies investigated whether ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus the non-nucleotide NS5B inhibitor GS-9669 or the NS3/4A protease inhibitor vedroprevir could reduce treatment duration and/or eliminate the need for ribavirin in genotype-1 HCV-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis. METHODS: In TRILOGY-1, 100 cirrhotic patients were randomized (1:1:1) to 8 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus GS-9669 250 mg or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus GS-9669 500 mg. In TRILOGY-2, 46 previously treated cirrhotic patients were randomized (1:1) to 8 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus vedroprevir ? ribavirin. The primary end points were the proportion of patients with sustained virological response 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation (SVR12) and safety. RESULTS: In both studies, most patients were male (each 65%) and white (92-96%), infected with HCV genotype-1a (62-70%) and had IL28B non-CC genotypes (82-87%). In total, 37-39% of patients were Hispanic or Latino. SVR12 rates were similar across treatment arms in TRILOGY-1 (82-91%) and TRILOGY-2 (88-95%); no patient had on-treatment virological failure. Two serious adverse events (acute myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy) were reported in two patients participating in TRILOGY-1, both of whom had pre-existing cardiac conditions. Laboratory abnormalities were infrequent. CONCLUSIONS: All ledipasvir/sofosbuvir-based regimens were well-tolerated. To shorten therapy and eliminate ribavirin, use of a more potent third agent or a third agent with a different mechanism of action may be required.""",1

However, 62% of HCC associated with CS and 58% of HCC in women under 40 not using CS were classified histologically as """"fibrolamellar"""" carcinoma. This subtype of HCC occurs predominantly in young people, both male and female. The apparent increase in HCC in young women can be explained by the presence of cases of fibrolamellar carcinoma in this age group, an the apparent association with CS is probably coincidental.""",1

Results from previous studies on ginsenosides' effects on human drug-metabolizing P450 enzymes are inconsistent and confusing. Herein, we first evaluated the inhibitory effects of fifteen ginsenosides and sapogenins on human CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes by using commercially available fluorescent probes. The structure-activity relationship of their effects on the P450s was also explored and a pharmacophore model was established for CYP3A4. Moreover, substrate-dependent phenomena were found in ginsenosides' effects on CYP3A4 when another fluorescent probe was used, and were further confirmed in tests with conventional drug probes and human liver microsomes. These substrate-dependent effects of the ginsenosides may provide an explanation for the inconsistent results obtained in previous GDI reports.",1

Those in the treatment group were additionally treated by acupuncture. All were treated for 6 weeks. Patients' efficacies were evaluated with Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Eisenberg antidepressant side effects scale (Asberg). Compared with the control group after 6 weeks of treatment, the cured-markedly effective rate was improved by 33.4% in the treatment group (P < 0.05). The HAMD was lower in the treatment group. The tendency of interaction of sleep disorder factor and anxiety/somatization factor was different between at the end of 1-week treatment and at the end of 6-week treatment in the treatment group (P < 0.05).

9563,9563,10217058,Criteria and recommendations for vitamin C intake,"Recommendations for vitamin C intake are under revision by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences. Since 1989 when the last recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of 60 mg was published, extensive biochemical, molecular, epidemiologic, and clinical data have become available. New recommendations can be based on the following 9 criteria: dietary availability, steady-state concentrations in plasma in relationship to dose, steady-state concentrations in tissues in relationship to dose, bioavailability, urine excretion, adverse effects, biochemical and molecular function in relationship to vitamin concentration, direct beneficial effects and epidemiologic observations in relationship to dose, and prevention of deficiency. We applied these criteria to the Food and Nutrition Board's new guidelines, the Dietary Reference Intakes, which include 4 reference values. The estimated average requirement (EAR) is the amount of nutrient estimated to meet the requirement of half the healthy individuals in a life-stage and gender group. Based on an EAR of 100 mg/d of vitamin C, the RDA is proposed to be 120 mg/d. If the EAR cannot be determined, an adequate intake (AI) amount is recommended instead of an RDA. The AI was estimated to be either 200 mg/d from 5 servings of fruits and vegetables or 100 mg/d of vitamin C to prevent deficiency with a margin of safety. The final classification, the tolerable upper intake level, is the highest daily level of nutrient intake that does not pose risk or adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the population. This amount is proposed to be less than 1 g of vitamin C daily. Physicians can tell patients that 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day may be beneficial in preventing cancer and providing sufficient vitamin C intake for healthy people, and that 1 g or more of vitamin C may have adverse consequences in some people.",1

1288,1288,6835306,The value of the autopsy in three medical eras,"To determine whether advances in diagnostic procedures have reduced the value of autopsies, we analyzed 100 randomly selected autopsies from each of the academic years 1960, 1970, and 1980 at one university teaching hospital. In all three eras about 10 per cent of the autopsies revealed a major diagnosis that, if known before death, might have led to a change in therapy and prolonged survival; another 12 per cent showed a clinically missed major diagnosis for which treatment would not have been changed. Among 1980 autopsies, renal disease and pulmonary embolus were less common causes of death than before, but systemic bacterial, viral, and fungal infections increased significantly and were missed clinically 24 per cent of the time. The introduction of radionuclide scans, ultrasound, and computerized tomography as diagnostic procedures did not reduce the use of conventional tests in patients who subsequently died and were studied by autopsy. Over-reliance on these new procedures occasionally contributed directly to missed major diagnoses. We conclude that advances in diagnostic technology have not reduced the value of the autopsy, and that a goal-directed autopsy remains a vital component in the assurance of good medical care.",0

Previous studies demonstrate that two liver-enriched microRNAs (miR-122 and miR-192) are promising biomarkers of acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury (APAP-ALI) in mice. We have examined these molecules, for the first time, in humans with APAP poisoning. Serum miR-122 and miR-192 were substantially higher in APAP-ALI patients, compared to healthy controls (median DeltaDeltaCt [25th, 75th percentile]) (miR-122: 1,265 [491, 4,270] versus 12.1 [7.0, 26.9], P < 0.0001; miR-192: 6.9 [2.0, 29.2] versus 0.44 [0.30, 0.69], P < 0.0001). A heart-enriched miR-1 showed no difference between APAP-ALI patients and controls, whereas miR-218 (brain-enriched) was slightly higher in the APAP-ALI cohort (0.17 [0.07, 0.50] versus 0.07 [0.04, 0.12]; P = 0.01). In chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, miR-122 and -192 were modestly higher, compared to controls (miR-122: 32.0 [21.1, 40.9] versus 12.1 [7.0, 26.9], P = 0.006; miR-192: 1.2 [0.74, 1.9] versus 0.44 [0.30, 0.69], P = 0.005), but miR-122 and -192 were substantially higher in APAP-ALI patients than CKD patients (miR-122: P < 0.0001; miR-192: P < 0.0004). miR-122 correlated with peak ALT levels in the APAP-ALI cohort (Pearson R = 0.46, P = 0.0005), but not with prothrombin time. miR-122 was also raised alongside peak ALT levels in a group of patients with non-APAP ALI. Day 1 serum miR-122 levels were almost 2-fold higher in APAP-ALI patients who satisfied King's College Criteria (KCC), compared to those who did not satisfy KCC, although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.15). CONCLUSION: This work provides the first evidence for the potential use of miRNAs as biomarkers of human drug-induced liver injury.""",1

METHODS: In this 8-week, single-blind, double-dummy, dose-ranging study, patients with acute gouty arthritis whose disease was refractory to or who had contraindications to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and/or colchicine were randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of canakinumab (10, 25, 50, 90, or 150 mg; n = 143) or an intramuscular dose of triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg; n = 57). Patients assessed pain using a 100-mm visual analog scale. RESULTS: Seventy-two hours after treatment, a statistically significant dose response was observed for canakinumab. All canakinumab doses were associated with numerically less pain than triamcinolone acetonide; thus, a dose with equivalent efficacy to triamcinolone acetonide 72 hours after treatment could not be determined. The reduction from baseline in pain intensity with canakinumab 150 mg was greater than with triamcinolone acetonide 24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment (differences of -11.5 mm [P = 0.04], -18.2 mm [P = 0.002], and -19.2 mm [P < 0.001], respectively), and 4, 5, and 7 days after treatment (all P < 0.05). Canakinumab significantly reduced the risk of recurrent flares versus triamcinolone acetonide (P ? 0.01 for all doses) (relative risk reduction 94% for canakinumab 150 mg versus triamcinolone acetonide). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar for canakinumab (41%) and triamcinolone acetonide (42%); most were mild or moderate in severity. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that canakinumab 150 mg provides rapid and sustained pain relief in patients with acute gouty arthritis, and significantly reduces the risk of recurrent flares compared with triamcinolone acetonide.""",1
2712,2712,15056517,Multiple versus single antipsychotic agents for hospitalized psychiatric patients: case-control study of risks versus benefits,"Since use of multiple drugs to treat psychiatric patients is increasing, and research on this practice is rare, the authors carried out a retrospective case-control study of multiple versus single antipsychotic treatment in psychiatric inpatients. Inpatient treatment groups receiving either antipsychotic monotherapy or polytherapy were matched in terms of age, sex, diagnostic category, and admission clinical ratings (Global Assessment of Functioning [GAF] and Clinical Global Impression [CGI]), which yielded 70 subject pairs. They were compared in terms of total chlorpromazine-equivalent daily dose, changes in total daily dose, length of hospitalization, incidence of adverse effects, and changes in clinical ratings (CGI, GAF, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score) between admission and discharge. Initial doses were closely similar at admission for both treatment groups, but the median total final antipsychotic dose was 78% higher for those receiving antipsychotic polytherapy versus monotherapy. Also, median length of stay in the hospital was 55% (8.5 days) longer, and risk of adverse effects was 56% higher with polytherapy, whereas clinical improvement scores were similar (within 11%) for both treatments. Short-term treatment with multiple antipsychotics was associated with major increases in drug exposure, adverse events, and time in the hospital but with no apparent gain in clinical benefit. These findings require further testing in controlled prospective studies. ",0

Abnormal liver function tests and leukopenia were common laboratory findings. Epidemiologic and environmental investigations traced the source of arsenic exposure to a farm well with water containing 108 ppm arsenic. The soil adjacent to the well was also contaminated with arsenic, possibly from waste pesticide. Presumably, arsenic gained access to the well through obvious leaks in the well's casing. To our knowledge, this is only the second reported outbreak of fatal arsenic poisoning from contaminated drinking water and one of few instances where illness followed exposure to a toxic substance which was disposed of, or possibly disposed of, in an indiscriminate manner.""",1

POLG1 was sequenced in patients from different European diagnostic and research centres to define the phenotypic spectrum and advance understanding of the recurrence risks. Mutations were identified in 38 cases, with the majority being sporadic compound heterozygotes. Eighty-nine DNA sequence changes were identified, including 2 predicted to alter a splice site, 1 predicted to cause a premature stop codon and 13 predicted to cause novel amino acid substitutions. The majority of children had a mutation in the linker region, often 1399G-->A (A467T), and a mutation affecting the polymerase domain. Others had mutations throughout the gene, and 11 had 3 or more substitutions. The clinical presentation ranged from the neonatal period to late adult life, with an overlapping phenotypic spectrum from severe encephalopathy and liver failure to late-onset external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, myopathy and isolated muscle pain or epilepsy. There was a strong gender bias in children, with evidence of an environmental interaction with sodium valproate. POLG1 mutations cause an overlapping clinical spectrum of disease with both dominant and recessive modes of inheritance. 1399G-->A (A467T) is common in children, but complete POLG1 sequencing is required to identify multiple mutations that can have complex implications for genetic counselling.",1

Among wait-listed patients, serum HBV DNA levels became undetectable (<1,000 copies/mL) in 59% and 65% at weeks 48 and 96, respectively. After 48 weeks, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time normalized in 77%, 76%, 60%, and 84% of wait-listed patients, respectively. Among posttransplantation patients, serum HBV DNA levels became undetectable in 40% and 65% at weeks 48 and 96, respectively. After 48 weeks, ALT, albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time normalized in 51%, 81%, 76%, and 56% of posttransplantation patients, respectively. Among wait-listed patients who underwent on-study liver transplantation, protection from graft reinfection over a median of 35 weeks was similar among patients who did (n = 34) or did not (n = 23) receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg). Hepatitis B surface antigen was detected on the first measurement only in 6% and 9% of patients who did or did not receive HBIg, respectively. Serum HBV DNA was detected on consecutive visits in 6% and 0% of patients who did or did not receive HBIg, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events led to discontinuation of adefovir dipivoxil in 4% of patients. Cumulative probabilities of resistance were 0%, 2%, and 2% at weeks 48, 96, and 144, respectively. In conclusion, adefovir dipivoxil is effective and safe in wait-listed or posttransplantation CHB patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV and prevents graft reinfection with or without HBIg.",1

The annual incidence of FH was estimated at 429 cases in 2004. FH is classified into acute or subacute type, and the prognosis of the latter is poor. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most frequently identifiable agent that causes FH in Japan. Transient HBV infection is more prevalent in the acute than subacute type, whereas the frequency of HBV carriers is greater in the subacute type. FH due to HBV reactivation from resolved hepatitis B has been increasingly observed in patients with malignant lymphoma treated with rituximab and corticosteroid combination therapy. The prognosis is poor in HBV carriers with acute exacerbation, especially in patients with HBV reactivation from resolved hepatitis B. Despite careful investigation, the etiology is still unknown in 16% and 39% of the acute and subacute type of FH, respectively. Autoimmune hepatitis and drug-allergy-induced liver injury are found in 7% and 10%, respectively, and are more frequently observed in the subacute type of FH. Living donor liver transplantation is now the standard care for individuals with poor prognosis. Artificial liver support with plasmapheresis and hemodiafiltration plays a central role while waiting for a donor liver or for the native liver to regenerate. Further research is necessary to identify the causes of unknown origin. In addition, to improve the prognosis of FH, it is necessary to establish treatment modalities that are effective for liver regeneration.",1

If complicated by cerebral oedema, orthotopic liver transplantation is the only established treatment. We report a case of combined ecstasy/cocaine-induced fulminant hepatic failure presenting with severe rhabdomyolysis, myocardial infarction and multiorgan failure. Transplantation was declined by the transplant surgeons because of a history of intravenous drug abuse. As excessive hyperammonaemia (318 mumol/l) and refractory transtentorial herniation developed, treatment with a new liver detoxification device combining high-flux haemodialysis and adsorption (FPSA-Prometheus) was initiated. Within a few hours of treatment, ammonia levels normalised. Cerebral oedema was greatly reduced by day 4 and hepatic function gradually recovered. Following neurologic rehabilitation for ischaemic sequelae of herniation, the patient was discharged from hospital with only minimal deficits. In conclusion, efficient extracorporeal detoxification may be an option for reversal of hyperammonaemia and refractory cerebral oedema in ecstasy/cocaine-induced acute liver failure.",1

THC-induced impairments in decision making are thought to be the result of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation, and although clinical literature suggests that chronic activation via THC contributes to perturbations in decision making, acute CB1 receptor modulation has yielded mixed results. Using an animal model to examine how CB1-specific ligands impact choice biases would provide significant insight as to how recruitment of the endocannabinoid system may influence decision making. Here, we used the rat gambling task (rGT), a validated analogue of the human Iowa Gambling Task, to assess baseline decision making preferences in male Wistar rats. After acquisition rGT performance was measured. Animals were challenged with the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant, the partial agonist THC, and the synthetic agonist WIN55,212-2. Animals were also treated acutely with the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597 to selectively upregulate the endocannabinoid anandamide. Blockade of the CB1 receptor produced a trend improvement in decision making in animals who preferred the advantageous task options, yet left choice unaffected in risk-prone rats. Neither CB1 receptor agonist had strong effects on decision making, but a high dose THC decreased premature responses, whereas WIN55,212-2 did the opposite. URB597 did not affect task performance. These results indicate that although chronic CB1 receptor activation may be associated with impaired decision making, acute modulation has modest effects on choice and instead may play a substantive role in regulating impulsive responding.

2667,2667,15047524,In vitro activities of piperacillin against beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae,"The in vitro activities of piperacillin (PIP) against beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin (AMP)-resistant (BLNAR) Haemophilus influenzae were compared with those of cefotaxime (CTX) and ceftriaxone (CRO), and the potency of PIP as therapy for meningitis caused by BLNAR is also discussed. PIP showed good activity (MIC at which 90% of strains are inhibited, 0.25 micro g/ml) against 69 BLNAR strains, and its activity was comparable to that of CRO and superior to that of CTX. No significant correlation was observed between the MICs of PIP and CTX or CRO or AMP, whereas a high correlation was observed between the MICs of CTX and CRO. In the killing study, PIP showed potent bactericidal activity compared with those of CTX and CRO. By microscopic examination, PIP caused the formation of a spindle and short filamentous cells with bulges and induced cell lysis in BLNAR strains, while treatment with CTX and CRO resulted in the formation of large, spherical cells without any obvious lysis. The affinity of Bocillin FL, a fluorescent penicillin used for determination of the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)s) for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), to PBPs 3a and 3b of BLNAR strains was drastically decreased compared with that to an AMP-susceptible strain (ATCC 33391). In the case of the BLNAR strains, the IC(50)s for PBPs 1a, 1b, and 2 were similar to those for the PBPs of ATCC 33391. Since the affinity of binding to PBPs 3a and 3b of the BLNAR strains decreased drastically, the second targets among the PBPs were PBP 2 for PIP, PBP1 (1a and 1b) for CTX and CRO. In conclusion, PIP showed excellent activities against BLNAR strains in a manner different from those of cephem antibiotics, suggesting that it could be a candidate therapeutic agent for the treatment of meningitis caused by BLNAR strains.

Five patients received 1 gm/day of ursodeoxycholic acid during 20 days and another three patients received two identical periods of treatment separated by a 14-day interval free of the drug. Pruritus and serum levels of total bile salts and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase improved significantly during treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. In the three patients who received two periods of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, pruritus and the laboratory alterations relapsed in the second week after the drug was discontinued, but they improved again when ursodeoxycholic acid was readministered. No adverse reactions were detected in the mothers or in their babies. All newborns were thriving normally during a follow-up period that lasted 5 mo after delivery. It is concluded that UDCA appears to be safe when administered in late pregnancy; its promising efficacy in the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy should now be confirmed in controlled clinical trials.""",1

In addition to drugs that release or mimic the effect of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), this could include drugs that inhibit: reuptake of norepinephrine or 5-hydroxytryptamine (also known as serotonin); bind to the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors or the cannabinoid receptors; and some peptides that reduce food intake. The sympathomimetic drugs phentermine, diethylpropion, benzphetamine, and phendimetrazine--so named because they mimic many effects of norepinephrine--are only approved in a few countries, and then only for short-term use. Sibutramine, a norepinephrine-5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitor, is approved for long-term use. Several new mechanisms for drug action are under investigation. Appetite suppressants should be viewed as useful adjuncts to diet and physical activity and might help selected patients to achieve and maintain weight loss.""",1

METHODS: In this prospective study, the entire ABCB4 gene coding sequence was analysed by DNA sequencing in 50 unrelated women with ICP defined by pruritus and raised serum alanine aminotransferase activity or bile acid concentration, with recovery after delivery. Genomic variants detected in patients with ICP were sought in 107 control pregnant women. Patients with ICP and controls were of Caucasian origin. RESULTS: Eight genomic variants were observed. One nonsense mutation (p.Arg144Stop) and two missense mutations (p.Ser320Phe and p.Thr775Met) were revealed each in one heterozygous patient. A third missense mutation (p.Arg590Gln) was detected in three heterozygous patients and in two homozygous patients also homozygous for a particular haplotype of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (c.175C>T, c.504T>C, c.711A>T). The chromosomal frequency of the p.Arg590Gln variant was significantly different between the ICP and control group (7.0% vs 0.5%; p = 0.0017; OR 16.03, 95% CI 1.94 to 132.16). An association was also found between allele T of the c.504T>C silent nucleotide polymorphism and ICP (68.0% vs 53.7%; p = 0.017; OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.11). The chromosomal frequency of the p.Arg652Gly variant did not differ between the ICP and control group (p = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that 16% of Caucasian patients with ICP bear ABCB4 gene mutations, and confirms the significant involvement of this gene in the pathogenesis of this complex disorder.""",1
6745,6745,30761815,Current perspectives for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia,"With an annual incidence of 1-2 in a million, Ph*(+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disease that makes myeloid neoplastic cells breed out of control. This BCR-ABL(+) myeloproliferative disease makes up about 15%-20% of all leukemia cases in adults. CML is seen more in males than females, with a rate of three to two. However, it does not show differences in prevalence in terms of age. CML consists of three clinical phases. The first one is the chronic phase, defined by rising white blood cell levels and also by myeloid proliferation and bone marrow maturation. While this phase does not exhibit complications, in diagnosis, it comprises most of the patients. The second phase is the accelerated phase, which the disease progresses to if it is not treated or does not respond to treatment. This usually takes about 3 years. The third phase is the blastic phase. The chronic phase can still progress to the next two phases within the first 2 years, with a rate of 10%. In the following years, the possibility increases by 15%-20% each year. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are revolutionary drugs for the management of disease course in CML. The aim of this review is to assess current approaches to CML patients' follow-up and treatment with TKIs. A literature search on CML and TKIs was made in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus with particular focus on randomized clinical trials, recommendations, guidelines, and expert opinions. In managing CML, various treatment methods have been utilized for many decades. Prior to the development of TKIs, interferon alpha was the primary tool, which was then complemented by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT was successful in slowing the disease down in the long term and curing up to 50% of patients. Then the coming of the imatinib era opened up different treatment perspectives. For the patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib, second- and third-generation TKIs are successfully used in distinct CML disease states. The survival benefits of TKIs including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib for CML patients are outstanding. TKI-related adverse events could impact the clinical course, especially in long-term drug administrations. The current aim for CML disease management in the TKI era is to provide age- and sex-matched normal life duration to CML patients. ",0

One hundred fifty-seven patients were randomised in two parallel groups: 78 started COS with Merional-HG and 79 with Menopur. Results of the study showed that both highly purified hMG preparations were equivalent in terms of number of oocytes retrieved (primary endpoint: 8.8 ? 3.9 versus 8.4 ? 3.8, p = 0.54). In the patients treated with Merional-HG, we observed a higher occurrence of mature oocytes (78.3% versus 71.4%, p = 0.005) and a reduced quantity of gonadotrophins administered per cycle (2.556 ? 636 IU versus 2.969 ? 855 IU, p < 0.001). Fertilisation, cleavage, implantation rates and the number of positive ?-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG; pregnancy) tests and the clinical pregnancy rate were comparable in the two groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. In conclusion, the results of this study support the efficacy and safety of Merional-HG administered subcutaneously for assisted reproduction techniques. Efficiency of Merional-HG appears to be higher due to reduced quantity of drug used and the higher yield of mature oocytes retrieved.""",1
10515,10515,14625346,Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity,"""The analgesic acetaminophen causes a potentially fatal, hepatic centrilobular necrosis when taken in overdose. The initial phases of toxicity were described in Dr. Gillette's laboratory in the 1970s. These findings indicated that acetaminophen was metabolically activated by cytochrome P450 enzymes to a reactive metabolite that depleted glutathione (GSH) and covalently bound to protein. It was shown that repletion of GSH prevented the toxicity. This finding led to the development of the currently used antidote N-acetylcysteine. The reactive metabolite was subsequently identified to be N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Although covalent binding has been shown to be an excellent correlate of toxicity, a number of other events have been shown to occur and are likely important in the initiation and repair of toxicity. Recent data have shown that nitrated tyrosine residues as well as acetaminophen adducts occur in the necrotic cells following toxic doses of acetaminophen. Nitrotyrosine was postulated to be mediated by peroxynitrite, a reactive nitrogen species formed by the very rapid reaction of superoxide and nitric oxide (NO). Peroxynitrite is normally detoxified by GSH, which is depleted in acetaminophen toxicity. NO synthesis (serum nitrate plus nitrite) was dramatically increased following acetaminophen. In inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) knockout mice, acetaminophen did not increase NO synthesis or tyrosine nitration; however, histological evidence indicated no difference in toxicity. Acetaminophen did not cause hepatic lipid peroxidation in wild-type mice but did cause lipid peroxidation in iNOS knockout mice. These data suggest that NO may play a role in controlling lipid peroxidation and that reactive nitrogen/oxygen species may be important in toxicity. The source of the superoxide has not been identified, but our recent finding that NADPH oxidase knockout mice were equally sensitive to acetaminophen and had equal nitration of tyrosine suggests that the superoxide is not from the activation of Kupffer cells. It was postulated that NAPQI-mediated mitochondrial injury may be the source of the superoxide. In addition, the significance of cytokines and chemokines in the development of toxicity and repair processes has been demonstrated by several recent studies. IL-1beta is increased early in acetaminophen toxicity and may be important in iNOS induction. Other cytokines, such as IL-10, macrophage inhibitory protein-2 (MIP-2), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), appear to be involved in hepatocyte repair and the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines.""",1

6934,6934,31405828,Long-term macrolide antibiotics for the treatment of bronchiectasis in adults: an individual participant data meta-analysis,"Bronchiectasis guidelines recommend long-term macrolide treatment for patients with three or more exacerbations per year without Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Randomised controlled trials suggest that long-term macrolide treatment can prevent exacerbations in adult patients with bronchiectasis, but these individual studies have been too small to do meaningful subgroup analyses. We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to explore macrolide benefit in subpopulations, including those in which macrolide therapy is not currently recommended. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science from Jan 1, 2000, to Sept 30, 2018, to identify double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of macrolide antibiotics in adult patients with bronchiectasis. We applied no language restrictions. Randomised controlled trials were eligible if treatment was defined a priori as long term and had a primary or secondary outcome of bronchiectasis exacerbations. Studies in patients with cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis were excluded. The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was frequency of exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics. Secondary endpoints were time to first exacerbation, change in quality of life according to the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and change in FEV Of 234 identified studies, we included three randomised controlled trials, and IPD was obtained for 341 participants. Macrolide antibiotics reduced the frequency of exacerbations (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·49, 95% CI 0·36 to 0·66; p<0·0001). We also found that macrolide treatment improved the time to first exacerbation (adjusted hazard ratio 0·46, 0·34 to 0·61; p<0·0001) and was associated with improved quality of life measured by the SGRQ (mean improvement 2·93 points, 0·03 to 5·83; p=0·048). Macrolides were not associated with a significant improvement in FEV Long-term macrolide treatment significantly reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis, with similar benefits observed in all subgroups based on patient characteristics. This finding suggests that macrolides might be considered in patients in whom macrolides are not indicated according to the current guidelines, particularly if alternative approaches to reduce exacerbations have been unsuccessful. However, downsides of long-term macrolide treatment must also be taken into account. European Respiratory Society. ",0

The monoclonal antibody romosozumab binds to sclerostin and increases bone formation. METHODS: In a phase 2, multicenter, international, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, eight-group study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of romosozumab over a 12-month period in 419 postmenopausal women, 55 to 85 years of age, who had low bone mineral density (a T score of -2.0 or less at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck and -3.5 or more at each of the three sites). Participants were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous romosozumab monthly (at a dose of 70 mg, 140 mg, or 210 mg) or every 3 months (140 mg or 210 mg), subcutaneous placebo, or an open-label active comparator--oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) or subcutaneous teriparatide (20 ?g daily). The primary end point was the percentage change from baseline in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine at 12 months. Secondary end points included percentage changes in bone mineral density at other sites and in markers of bone turnover. RESULTS: All dose levels of romosozumab were associated with significant increases in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, including an increase of 11.3% with the 210-mg monthly dose, as compared with a decrease of 0.1% with placebo and increases of 4.1% with alendronate and 7.1% with teriparatide. Romosozumab was also associated with large increases in bone mineral density at the total hip and femoral neck, as well as transitory increases in bone-formation markers and sustained decreases in a bone-resorption marker. Except for mild, generally nonrecurring injection-site reactions with romosozumab, adverse events were similar among groups. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women with low bone mass, romosozumab was associated with increased bone mineral density and bone formation and with decreased bone resorption.

However, there are limited evidence-based reviews on their efficacy, short-term safety, and tolerability. AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy, short-term safety, and tolerability of UV-based therapy in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating NB-UVB, BB-UVB, and PUVA in adults with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis. Our efficacy outcomes were ? Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)-75 and clearance. We evaluated the short-term safety and tolerability from the percentage of adverse effects and withdrawal due to adverse effects, respectively. RESULTS: Forty-one RCTs, with a total of 2,416 patients, met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. In regard to PASI-75 in monotherapy trials, PUVA (mean: 73 %, 95 % CI 56-88) was the most effective modality. Trials with BB-UVB also showed a high PASI-75 (73 %) but with a wide CI (18-98) due to heterogeneity of the total available three studies. This was followed by NB-UVB (mean: 62 %, 95 % CI 45-79) then bath PUVA (mean: 47 %, 95 % CI 30-65). In regard to clearance in the monotherapy trials, PUVA (mean: 79 %, 95 % CI 69-88) was superior to NB-UVB (mean: 68 %, 95 % CI 57-78), BB-UVB (mean: 59 %, 95 % CI 44-72), and bath PUVA (mean: 58 %, 95 % CI 44-72). The percentages of asymptomatic erythema development in monotherapy trials were 64 % for BB-UVB, 57 % for NB-UVB, 45 % for PUVA, and 34 % for bath PUVA. Symptomatic erythema or blistering percentages for the monotherapy trials were as follows: 7.8 % for NB-UVB, 2 % for BB-UVB, 17 % for PUVA, and 21 % for bath PUVA. The percentages of withdrawal due to adverse effects were 2 % for NB-UVB, 4.6 % for BB-UVB, 5 % for PUVA, and 0.7 % for bath PUVA monotherapy trials. CONCLUSIONS: As a monotherapy, PUVA was more effective than NB-UVB, and NB-UVB was more effective than BB-UVB and bath PUVA in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis, based on clearance as an end point. Based on PASI-75, the results were similar except for BB-UVB, which showed a high mean PASI-75 (73 %) that was similar to PUVA, but with a wide CI (18-98).

Acute dose-response studies showed that all five drugs improved exercise tolerance and reduced ST-segment depression, heart rate and blood pressure by a similar degree in comparison with a placebo (P less than 0.01). Near maximum improvement in exercise tolerance occurred when the acute cumulative oral dose had reached 160 mg for propranolol and oxprenolol, 200 mg for metoprolol and tolamolol and 400 mg for practolol. When these drugs were administered as a single doses, increase in walking time before the development of angina and reduction in ST-segment depression, heart rate and systolic blood pressure all occurred within one hour and persisted for eight hours--effects markedly different from the response to a placebo (P less than 0.01). These data show that non-cardioselective agents (propranolol and oxprenolol), cardioselective agents (practolol, metoprolol and tolamolol), as well as drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (oxprenolol and practolol), were equally effective in the treatment of angina pectoris.",0

11903,11903,19669383,A case of lamivudine-sensitive de novo acute hepatitis B induced by rituximab with the CHOP regimen for diffuse large B cell lymphoma,"A case of de novo acute hepatitis B that showed symptoms of general malaise and anorexia during rituximab therapy with the CHOP regimen for diffuse large B cell lymphoma is reported. Lamivudine was strikingly effective, showing a rapid recovery from liver damage with jaundice. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in serum became and stayed undetectable even after the withdrawal of lamivudine, although HBsAg remained positive over 42 months from the onset. Liver biopsy showed a picture suggestive of acute viral hepatitis with multinucleated giant hepatocytes and CD38-positive plasma cell infiltration into liver parenchyma. Immunohistochemically, CD3-positive T-cells were predominant cells that infiltrated in liver parenchyma, whereas CD20-positive B cells were essentially null. Hence, it is suggested from these findings that B lymphocytes might be crucial for the continuous latency in HBV infection and may give rise to de novo acute hepatitis B if totally deleted. Moreover, the CHOP regimen might have some additive effects with the repeated on-off use of corticosteroids to the onset of the disease.

The median time to progression was 1.8 months (95% CI, 1.6 to 3.4 months), and median overall survival time was 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 8.7 months). Sorafenib was well tolerated with few grade 3 and no grade 4 toxicities. Biomarker analysis of paired tumor samples before and after treatment with sorafenib revealed a decrease of pERK in all five patients, with a decrease in Ki67 in four patients, consistent with a disruption of ERK signaling. The antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 was downregulated in four patients, and there was also evidence of antiangiogenic activity. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib was well tolerated and had modest anticancer activity comparable to monotherapy with other targeted agents in this group of patients. Further development in combination with radiation or other agents may be warranted.""",1

8092,8092,3944744,Hepatomegaly following short-term high-dose steroid therapy,"Children treated with large doses of corticosteroids were found to develop hepatomegaly within a few days. No relationship could be established between the condition for which steroids were given and the liver enlargement. Liver biopsy was thought to be indicated, and thus was performed in three children because of diagnostic uncertainty. The light and electron microscopic examinations revealed normal liver architecture, without edema, sinusoid engorgement, or inflammatory changes. The hepatocytes were distended by increased amounts of glycogen. In a pattern reminiscent of some glycogen storage diseases, mitochondria and other cytosol components were displaced toward the cell membrane or around the nucleus, which occasionally contained glycogen. Moderate sinusoidal compression, interhepatocytic free glycogen particles, and mild increase in lipid droplets were also found. It is concluded that the hepatomegaly noted in patients given short-term, high-dosage steroid therapy is due to excessive glycogen accumulation within parenchymal cells. This finding is in accordance with observations in animals, as well as with biochemical studies demonstrating hepatocytic glycogen deposition after steroid therapy. Being benign and reversible, early hepatomegaly following administration of high-dose corticosteroids should not influence the initial therapeutic plan required by the basic disease.",1

One hundred and two patients completed this double blind, 16-week crossover study. During the first eight weeks, the patients treated with diethylpropion hydrochloride lost significantly (P smaller than 0.001) more weight than the patients treated with placebo (an average of 11-1 lb or 6-4% of their initial weight as compared with 6-2 lb or 3-6% of their initial weight). When the group taking diethylpropion hydrochloride crossed over to placebo for a second eight weeks, they lost an average of 1-5 lb (0-9% of their weight at the start of the second period), while the group who crossed from placebo over to diethylpropion hydrochloride lost an average of 6-7 lb (3-8%).

12824,12824,22850321,Temozolomide-related idiosyncratic and other uncommon toxicities: a systematic review,"Temozolomide (TMZ)-related idiosyncratic and other uncommon toxicities have been reported. To better characterize these toxicities and to identify any associated risk factors, we performed a systematic review. We searched the PubMed database, limited to the English language, published between 1999 and December 2011. We selected only those articles in which TMZ was temporally related and was the sole or main contributing chemotherapeutic drug to idiosyncratic drug reactions (IDRs) and other uncommon toxicities. Hematological IDRs are biopsy-proven aplastic anemia or grade V toxicity or grade IV toxicity with slow and incomplete hematological recovery. Seventy-three cases were identified, including 21 hematological IDRs, 31 nonhematological IDRs and uncommon infections, and 21 second primary cancers. With a caveat of publication and reporting bias, the following observations could be made. The hematological IDRs predominantly occurred in female patients (exact binomial two-tailed, P=0.0041) and most patients were receiving TMZ concomitantly with radiotherapy for glioma. The median duration of exposure to TMZ was 30 days and the median cumulative TMZ exposure was 2250 mg/m (range, 500-6900 mg/m). The sex predilection was not evident in nonhematological IDRs and other uncommon toxicities. TMZ-induced pneumonitis and cholestatic hepatitis are emerging as a nonhematological hypersensitive reaction and IDR, respectively. For TMZ-related myelodysplasia or leukemia, the cumulative dose of TMZ ranged from 1400 to 30 000 mg/m. The cumulative dose of TMZ was lower and latency was shorter with a previous exposure to other leukemogenic drugs, suggesting that TMZ may have augmented the leukemogenic potential of other drugs. Early appearance of profound myelosuppression during the course of TMZ and concurrent radiotherapy could be a hematological IDR, which warrants prompt investigations to exclude aplastic anemia. Myelodysplasia or leukemia developed after a median TMZ exposure of 15 g/m.",1

Its efficacy in severe dementia has not been assessed and is controversial. Our aim was to ascertain the effectiveness of donepezil in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease, by focusing primarily on cognition and activities of daily living. METHODS: We did a 6-month, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in 248 patients with severe Alzheimer's disease (mini mental state examination score 1-10) who were living in assisted care nursing homes ran by trained staff in Sweden. We assigned patients oral donepezil (5 mg per day for 30 days then up to 10 mg per day thereafter, n=128) or matched placebo (n=120). Our primary endpoints were change from baseline to month 6 in the severe impairment battery (SIB) and modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living inventory for severe Alzheimer's disease (ADCS-ADL-severe). We analysed outcomes for patients with data at baseline and at one or more other timepoints (modified intent-to-treat population) with last observation carried forward used to replace missing data. FINDINGS: 95 patients assigned donepezil and 99 patients assigned placebo completed the study. Patients treated with donepezil improved more in SIB scores and declined less in ADCS-ADL-severe scores at 6 months after initiation of treatment compared with baseline than did controls (least squares [LS] mean difference, 5.7, 95% CI 1.5-9.8; p=0.008, and 1.7, 0.2-3.2; p=0.03, respectively). The incidence of adverse events was comparable between groups (donepezil 82% [n=105] vs placebo 76% [n=91]), with most being transient and mild or moderate in severity. More patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events in the donepezil group (n=20) than in the placebo group (n=8). INTERPRETATION: Donepezil improves cognition and preserves function in individuals with severe Alzheimer's disease who live in nursing homes.""",1

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 329 medical charts of patients who were treated with Regimen I and discharged after cure between March 2000 and April 2006 was carried out at the Tuberculosis Outpatient Clinic, Department of Pulmonology of the Santa Casa de Miseric?rdia de S?o Paulo Hospital in the city of S?o Paulo, Brazil. Adverse effects and the timing of their appearance, as well as subsequent modifications in the treatment regimen, were investigated. RESULTS: We included 297 patients, 146 (49.1%) of whom presented one or more adverse effects related to antituberculosis medications. The frequency of minor side effects was 41.1%, and that of major side effects was 12.8%. The most common reactions were those involving the gastrointestinal tract (40.3%) and the skin (22.1%). Adverse effects were more common in the first and second months of treatment (58.4%). Modification of the treatment regimen was necessary in 11 cases (3.7% of the total sample). Drug-induced hepatitis was the adverse effect that demanded the most regimen changes. CONCLUSIONS: In this group of patients, the frequency of adverse effects related to treatment with Regimen I was 49.1%. However, in most of the cases, it was not necessary to modify the treatment regimen due to side effects.",1

Validation of oral 64copper with copper balance,"The efficacy of zinc as a therapeutic agent to control copper balance in Wilson's disease patients has been previously documented with balance studies. In an attempt to develop a simpler and faster tool for evaluating the adequacy of zinc therapy, a technique that measures the uptake into blood of a small oral dose of 64copper was studied in conjunction with copper balance. The mean peak 64copper uptake into blood of nine Wilson's disease patients on D-penicillamine, trien, or no medication was 6.04 +/- 2.74%, comparable with normal controls. Seven patients on zinc therapy had a markedly and significantly reduced mean uptake of 0.79 +/- 1.05% after treatment. The data demonstrate that the prevention of copper uptake into blood in Wilson's disease patients by zinc therapy can be evaluated by 64copper uptake and that peak uptakes of less than 1% occur in patients with neutral or negative copper balance.",1

The two-page survey was completed by 57% of a random sample of 2,500 members of the American Gastroenterological Association and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Analysis was limited to the 1,249 responses from physicians who spent at least 1 day per week in patient care. These physicians frequently managed patients with HCV, and nearly three quarters treated patients with interferon. To prevent transmission, the large majority of physicians recommended measures to avoid blood exposures, were uncertain or disagreed about the importance of sexual contact, and did not caution patients about casual contact. More than 70% of physicians told their patients to stop or minimize alcohol consumption. In the management of a patient with antibody to HCV but normal serum aminotransferase activities, 87% of physicians would have ordered a supplemental test, and if HCV were confirmed, 46% would have obtained a liver biopsy, but only 15% would have treated the patient with interferon. For a patient with chronic HCV infection and elevated serum aminotransferase activities, more than 90% of physicians would have obtained a liver biopsy and approximately 60% would have treated with interferon. Physicians who are most familiar with the management of patients with HCV generally agreed with the recommendations of the Consensus Development Conference Panel regarding prevention of transmission, minimizing alcohol consumption, and managing patients with typical presentations. Controversies remain regarding some issues of general management, the value of molecular testing, and the need to treat certain patients with interferon.",0

Japan HBV Genotype Research Group,"Clinical and molecular virological differences were evaluated in 50 Japanese patients chronically infected with HBV of genotype B and C who were matched for age and sex as well as the severity of liver disease in a case-control study. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was significantly less frequent (16% vs. 42%, P <.01), whereas antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) was significantly more common (84% vs. 56%, P <. 01) in genotype B than C patients. The predominance of mutants with G-to-A mutation at nucleotide (nt) 1896 in the precore region (A1896) over the wild-type was comparable between genotype B and C patients (60% and 62%, respectively), and it correlated with anti-HBe. The double mutation in the basic core promoter (A-to-T at nt 1762 and G-to-A at nt 1764), however, was significantly more frequent in genotype C than B patients (58% vs. 16%, P <.01), and it did not correlate with anti-HBe or HBeAg. By the multiple logistic regression analysis, the double mutation in the basic core promoter (T1762/A1764) was significantly associated with genotype C [odds ratio (OR), 9.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.4-25.1]], age > or = 35 years (OR, 5.5; CI, 1.5-20.5), and more advanced liver disease (OR, 4.1; CI, 1.6-10.2), but it was not associated with sex, HBeAg, HBV DNA, or the precore mutation (A1896). These results suggest a role of the double mutation in the basic core promoter in association with genotype C and a longer duration of infection in the aggravation of chronic hepatitis B.",0

LDL cholesterol values did not change in the LNg-IUD group, whereas a 10.3% decrease was observed in the oral therapy group. Triglyceride values did not change in either group. There were no significant differences in the serum lipoprotein changes between the groups during the treatment. The use of a non-oral regimen of hormone replacement therapy has been advocated to minimize the effect of steroids on the liver. Its effects on the serum pattern of lipids and lipoproteins, however, did not differ significantly from those induced by a continuous oral treatment regimen. ",0

A reappraisal of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use,"Diltiazem is a calcium antagonist effective in the treatment of stable, variant and unstable angina pectoris and mild to moderate systemic hypertension, with a generally favourable adverse effect profile. It is also effective in terminating supraventricular tachycardia and in controlling the ventricular response to atrial fibrillation/flutter. Atrioventricular block, the risk of which may be exacerbated by concomitant beta-adrenoceptor antagonist therapy, occurs rarely as an adverse effect of diltiazem treatment. Diltiazem appears to exert complex cardioprotective effects which have been of benefit after intracoronary administration to patients undergoing coronary angiography and bypass procedures. In addition, long term diltiazem treatment has produced a significant reduction in subsequent cardiac events in patients with non-Q wave myocardial infarction. Thus, diltiazem is an effective and well-tolerated first-line or alternative treatment of patients with ischaemic heart disease, systemic hypertension, and supraventricular arrhythmias, with possible potential in limiting ischaemia-induced myocardial damage.",1

The incidence of and mortality from primary liver cancer, as well as the prevalence of oral contraceptive usage, have both been rising to Italy since the late 1950s. 21 cases of liver cancer, in women aged 32-59 (median 50), occurred in the Milan area during the study period. These women, and 145 controls matched for age but admitted to hospitals for a variety of non-neoplastic diseases, were interviewed with a structured questionnaire covering socio-demographics, life style, diet, medical history, and history of use of oral contraceptives and other drugs. 19.0% of the cases had used oral contraceptives compared to 7.6% of controls, a relative risk of 1.8 for up to 5 years' use, and 8.3 for 5 years. History of hepatitis was associated with 14% of cases and 7% of controls. Italians have a higher incidence of liver neoplasms that northern Europeans and Americans, probably because of higher incidence of risk factors, such as hepatitis and alcohol use. The attributable risk for oral contraception, however, is lower in this population.",1
2388,2388,11172139,Transplantation of bone marrow as compared with peripheral-blood cells from HLA-identical relatives in patients with hematologic cancers,"BACKGROUND: In recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplants, peripheral-blood cells mobilized with the use of filgrastim (recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) engraft more rapidly than bone marrow. However, the relative effects of these techniques on the rates of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, overall survival, and disease-free survival have not been determined in randomized studies. METHODS: Between March 1996 and July 1999, 172 patients (12 to 55 years of age) with hematologic cancer were randomly assigned to receive either bone marrow or filgrastim-mobilized peripheral-blood cells from HLA-identical relatives for hematopoietic rescue after the treatment of hematologic cancer with high doses of chemotherapy, with or without radiation. RESULTS: The recovery of both neutrophils and platelets was faster with peripheral-blood cells than with marrow (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The cumulative incidence of grade II, III, or IV acute graft-versus-host disease at 100 days was 64 percent with peripheral-blood cells and 57 percent with marrow (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.81; P=0.35). The cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 46 percent with peripheral-blood cells and 35 percent with marrow (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 1.90; P=0.54). The estimated overall probability of survival at two years was 66 percent with peripheral-blood cells and 54 percent with marrow (hazard ratio for death, 0.62; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.38 to 1.02; P=0.06). The rate of disease-free survival at two years was 65 percent with peripheral-blood cells and 45 percent with marrow (hazard ratio for relapse or death, 0.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.38 to 0.95; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In patients given high-dose chemotherapy, with or without radiation, for the treatment of hematologic cancer, allogeneic peripheral-blood cells used for hematopoietic rescue restore blood counts faster than allogeneic bone marrow, without increasing the risk of graft-versus-host disease.",0
8862,8862,7590650,Efficacy and safety of interferon alfa therapy in chronic hepatitis C with autoantibodies to liver-kidney microsomes,"Interferon alfa (IFN) therapy is efficacious in chronic viral hepatitides. It may, however, cause adverse immunologic reactions in patients with concomitant autoimmune phenomena. A minority of patients with chronic type C hepatitis have antibodies against liver and kidney microsomes (anti-LKM) in serum. We therefore carried out this study to find out whether IFN is safe and efficacious also in this subgroup. We treated 92 consecutive cases of chronic hepatitis C with IFN. Twelve patients had anti-LKM< and the remaining 80 tested negative to the anti-LKM. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was diagnosed on the basis of positive anti-HCV and HCV-RNA tests. We compared the clinical and virological virological results of the therapy and the side effects found in the two groups. We found that the response to therapy and the outcome after 1 year of follow-up were similar. Treatment was discontinued in one anti-LKM-positive patient because of a drastic increase in ALT levels at the fourth month of therapy. No untoward effect was observed in the other cases. Hepatitis C patients with anti-LKM may be exposed to an increased risk of an adverse hepatitic reaction while being treated with IFN. However, we found that the extent of the risk was minimal compared with the expected benefits of the therapy. IFN is therefore recommended as the first therapy to choose in these patients. They must, however, be monitored more closely for possible liver dysfunction than the ordinary hepatitis C patient.",1

We describe the rate and duration of adverse events in a randomized controlled trial of atomoxetine (ATX) and parent training (PT) for ADHD symptoms and noncompliance in children with ASD. METHODS: We conducted a 10-week, double-blind, 2???2 trial of ATX and PT with 128 children (ages 5-14) randomized to ATX alone, ATX+PT, placebo+PT, or placebo alone. For 6 weeks, ATX (or placebo) doses were clinically adjusted to a maximum of 1.8?mg/(kg?day) and maintained for an additional 4 weeks. An average of seven PT sessions were conducted in the two PT arms. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed through parent ratings of common symptoms on a seven-point Likert severity scale and through direct interviews with study medical staff. RESULTS: ATX was associated with decreased appetite and fatigue, but was otherwise well tolerated. Most reported AEs lasted 4 weeks or less. Unlike reports with typically developing (TD) children, there were no concerns with QTc changes or suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the findings of previous studies of ATX in ASD by documenting that the type of AEs was similar to that of TD children, with no significant safety concerns.",1

In all, 522 patients age 15 to 55 years old and presenting with at least 1 conventional high-risk factor were candidates for SCT in first complete remission. Among these, 282 (54%) received a transplant in first complete remission. At 3 years, posttransplant cumulative incidences of relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and relapse-free survival (RFS) were estimated at 19.5%, 15.5%, and 64.7%, respectively. Time-dependent analysis did not reveal a significant difference in RFS between SCT and no-SCT cohorts. However, SCT was associated with longer RFS in patients with postinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) ≥10(-3) (hazard ratio, 0.40) but not in good MRD responders. In B-cell precursor ALL, SCT also benefitted patients with focal IKZF1 gene deletion (hazard ratio, 0.42). This article shows that poor early MRD response, in contrast to conventional ALL risk factors, is an excellent tool to identify patients who may benefit from allogeneic SCT in the context of intensified adult ALL therapy.

Therefore, the effects of IFNalpha on behaviour and cytokine changes in the whole blood culture and in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus areas of the brain in wistar rats were investigated with emphasis on the role of paroxetine in the prevention of depressive behaviour induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines. The group of rats treated with IFNalpha (s.c. 50,000 IU/kg for 3 days/week for 5 weeks) was compared with three other groups; 1) saline control group (s.c. normal saline 0.2 ml/kg/day for 7 weeks), 2) paroxetine control group (paroxetine suspension orally 10 mg/kg/day for 7 weeks) and 3) group treated with paroxetine for 2 weeks followed by IFNalpha for 5 weeks. In open filed, the IFNalpha treated rats showed anxiety behaviour compared to the rats from the other groups. There was no significant difference in home cage emergence test, Morris water maze and object recognition test. There is no significant difference in plasma corticosterone between groups. The pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL1beta and IFNgamma), were significantly higher whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL10 was lower in the stimulated whole blood culture of IFNalpha treated rats. In the brain, both pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1beta and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 were higher in hypothalamus of the IFNalpha treated rats; by contrast the concentration of IL10 was lowest in hippocampus region of this group compared to the other groups. The paroxetine pretreated rats did not show these cytokine changes following IFNalpha treatment. Thus it appears that paroxetine pretreatment prevents the pro-inflammatory changes in blood and brain following IFNalpha treatment in turn prevents the anxiety behaviour. ",0

We here present an update of our single-center experience with fludarabine-melphalan as a preparative regimen. Fifty-eight patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent RIC and allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a matched related donor (MRD; n=25) or a matched unrelated donor (MUD; n=33). Forty-eight (83%) had undergone prior autologous stem cell transplantation. Disease status at transplant was refractory relapse (n=28) or sensitive relapse (n=30). Cumulative day 100 and 2-year transplant-related mortality rates were 7% and 15%, respectively (day 100 transplant-related mortality MRD vs. MUD 8% vs. 6%, p=ns; 2-year MRD vs. MUD 13% vs. 16%, p=ns). The cumulative incidence of acute (grade II-IV) graft-versus-host disease in the first 100 days was 28% (MRD vs. MUD 12% vs. 39%, p=0.04). The cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease at any time was 73% (MRD vs. MUD 57% vs. 85%, p=0.006). Projected 2-year overall and progression-free survival rates are 64% (49-76%) and 32% (20-45%), with 2-year disease progression/relapse at 55% (43-70%). There was no statistically significant differences in overall survival progression-free survival, and disease progression/relapse between MRD and MUD transplants. There was a trend for the response status pretransplant to have a favorable impact on progression-free survival (p=0.07) and disease progression/relapse (p=0.049), but not on overall survival (p=0.4) Fludarabine-melphalan as a preparative regimen for reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation in progression-free survival Hodgkin's lymphoma is associated with a significant reduction in transplant-related mortality, with comparable results in MRD and MUD allografts. Optimizing pretransplant response status may improve patients' outcome. ",0

Hypertension, diarrhea, weight loss, proteinuria, fatigue, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia are reported among the most frequent AEs, often leading to discontinuations or dose modifications. This paper reports a case series focusing on the role of the immediate multidisciplinary approach to manage AEs. ",0

CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old healthy woman from Iraq developed acute cholestatic hepatitis 3 weeks following repair of the right rotator cuff under general anesthesia. There was no evidence for viral, autoimmune, or metabolic causes of hepatitis. No other medications were involved except for dipyrone for analgesia. The alanine aminotransferase was elevated to a peak concentration of 1533 U/L and the serum bilirubin reached a peak of 17.0 mg/dL. There was slow improvement over 4 months. Accidental reexposure by the patient to dipyrone was uneventful. DISCUSSION: The clinical and histologic picture of this case resembles halothane hepatitis, which has a significant mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Isoflurane, a common anesthetic agent, can cause severe cholestatic hepatitis.",1

Ten men with gonadotrophin deficiency requiring induction of spermatogenesis and fertility were treated with HCG for 3-6 months followed by the s.c. self-administration of injections of r-hFSH in combination with HCG for 18 months. Among the eight men who commenced r-hFSH treatment, seven demonstrated sperm output at a median of 6 months and five achieved the target sperm output of 1. 5x10(6) per ml at a median of 9 months of FSH treatment. Mean testicular volume increased by 4.2 ml during FSH treatment. Three men produced pregnancies in their partners, two of which resulted in the birth of healthy babies and a third patient's partner had a miscarriage. We conclude that r-hFSH is well tolerated and effective in inducing testis growth, spermatogenesis and fertility in gonadotrophin-deficient men. The efficacy of r-hFSH seems comparable with urinary FSH at restoring normal fertility in gonadotrophin-deficient men.",1

Her prolonged course, which failed to respond to an end-to-side portacaval shunt procedure, mimicked chronic hepatitis evolving to cirrhosis. Additional noteworthy features were the presence of two small benign hepatic adenomas, observed both at biopsy and at necropsy, a lesion recently recognized as a complication of anovulatory drugs, and widespread hepatic calcifications found at autopsy.",1
14156,14156,28361290,Efficacy and safety of atazanavir/ritonavir-based antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infected subjects: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Atazanavir (ATZ) is a well-tolerated protease inhibitor that can be boosted with ritonavir (r) to treat infection with resistant strains of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy, safety, and metabolic effects of ATZ/r regimen versus commonly used antiretroviral drugs such as lopinavir (LPV) and darunavir (DRV) in HIV-1-infected patients. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL, using relevant keywords. Data were extracted from eligible randomized trials and pooled as risk ratios (RR) or standardized mean differences (SMD) in a meta-analysis model using RevMan software. Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (3292 patients) were eligible for the final analysis. After 96 weeks of treatment, the pooled effect estimate did not favor either ATZ/r or LPV/r in terms of virological failure rate (RR 1.11, 95% CI [0.74, 1.66]). However, ATZ/r was marginally superior to LPV/r in terms of increasing the proportion of patients with HIV RNA <50 copies/ml (RR 1.09, 95% CI [1.01, 1.17]). The pooled effect estimate did not favor ATZ/r over DRV/r regarding the change in plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, or high-density lipoprotein at 24, 48, and 96 weeks. Moreover, no significant difference was found between the two regimens (ATZ/r and DRV/r) in terms of change in visceral (SMD -0.06, 95%CI [-0.33, 0.21]) or subcutaneous adipose tissue (SMD 0.12, 95% CI [-0.15, 0.39]). The ATZ/r regimen was generally as effective and well-tolerated as the LPV/r regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 patients. Compared to the DRV/r regimen, ATZ/r has no favorable effect on the plasma lipid profile or adipose tissue distribution.",1
9215,9215,8800624,Ocular chloramphenicol and aplastic anaemia. Is there a link?,"The question of a link between the use of topical ocular chloramphenicol and the incidence of aplastic anaemia continues to be a controversial issue in ophthalmological spheres. At present topical ocular chloramphenicol is widely used in the UK for the treatment of conjunctivitis, whereas it is very rarely prescribed for this indication in the U.S. Individual policies vary around the rest of the world. The evidence for and against any association between topical and ocular chloramphenicol and an increased risk of aplastic anaemia is reviewed, and the reasons behind the current prescribing policies are clarified. The discussion generated in the literature over the past 2 years over this issue is considered, along with the published debate from the past 3 decades. The debate is not conclusive, but by presenting or referencing the specific case reports and the published opinions of various experts, we hope to enable the reader to make his or her own informed decision as to whether use of the topical preparation of chloramphenicol should be considered by the ophthalmological community.",1

The purpose of this study is to review the literature in order to estimate the prevalence and magnitude of HA in VPA treated patients, to establish any association with hepatotoxicity and encephalopathy and to identify any factors associated with its occurrence. A search of MEDLINE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, between 1980 and 2005 was performed. Out of 183 studies, 24 met our inclusion criteria. The prevalence of HA in the prospective studies ranged between 70% and 100%, while in cross-sectional studies it varied between 16% and 100%. Ammonia (NH(3)) blood levels increased by a two-fold average relative to the baseline levels. There was no association between HA and clinical symptoms. Concomitant administration of other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was the factor most frequently associated with HA.""",1
11797,11797,19318348,Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in the UK: 1995 to 2007,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDRTB) is a threat to global tuberculosis control. Limited information is, however, available on the outcome of XDRTB cases. This study describes the susceptibility to second- and third-line antituberculosis drugs among MDRTB cases and treatment outcome of identified XDRTB cases. METHOD: The results of second-line antituberculosis drug susceptibility tests in the UK between January 1995 and December 2007 were retrospectively reviewed and clinicians contacted for treatment outcome of XDRTB cases. Participants included all 678 patients with culture-confirmed MDRTB in the UK. The main outcome measures were the proportion of isolates resistant to second-line antituberculosis drugs and treatment outcome for XDRTB cases. RESULTS: Among MDRTB isolates, levels of resistance to amikacin, capreomycin, ciprofloxacin, cycloserine, ethionamide and p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) were 5.5, 3.4, 5.6, 5.1, 14.0 and 16.7%, respectively. Six XDRTB cases (0.9% of MDR cases) were identified during this period. Two further cases of XDRTB were reported in 2008. Five individuals with XDRTB died of tuberculosis within 3 years of diagnosis and three are still on treatment. CONCLUSION: Levels of MDRTB remain low, and those of XDRTB very low, in this high income country. The case fatality ratio among XDRTB cases was high despite low levels of HIV co-infection.",1
2592,2592,12774003,Propranolol plus placebo versus propranolol plus isosorbide-5-mononitrate in the prevention of a first variceal bleed: a double-blind RCT,"Nonselective beta-blockers are very effective in preventing first variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. Treatment with isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-MN) plus propranolol achieves a greater reduction in portal pressure than propranolol alone. The present multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial evaluated whether combined drug therapy could be more effective than propranolol alone in preventing variceal bleeding. A total of 349 consecutive cirrhotic patients with gastroesophageal varices were randomized to receive propranolol + placebo (n = 174) or propranolol + IS-MN (n = 175). There were no significant differences in the 1- and 2-year actuarial probability of variceal bleeding between the 2 groups (propranolol + placebo, 8.3% and 10.6%; propranolol + IS-MN, 5% and 12.5%). The only independent predictor of variceal bleeding was a variceal size greater than 5 mm. However, among patients with varices greater than 5 mm (n = 196), there were no significant differences in the incidence of variceal bleeding between the 2 groups. Survival was also similar. Adverse effects were significantly more frequent in the propranolol + IS-MN group due to a greater incidence of headache. There were no significant differences in the incidence of new-onset or worsening ascites or in impairment of renal function. In conclusion, propranolol effectively prevents variceal bleeding. Adding IS-MN does not further decrease the low residual risk of bleeding in patients receiving propranolol. However, the long-term use of this combination drug therapy is safe and may be an alternative in clinical conditions associated with a greater risk of bleeding.",0
11433,11433,18056280,Entecavir for treatment of hepatitis B virus displays no in vitro mitochondrial toxicity or DNA polymerase gamma inhibition,"Therapy with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) can be associated with mitochondrial toxicity. In vitro studies have been used to predict the predisposition for and characterize the mechanisms causing mitochondrial toxicity. Entecavir (ETV) is an approved deoxyguanosine nucleoside for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection that exhibits potent activity against viral reverse transcriptase. We assessed the potential for mitochondrial toxicity of ETV in long-term cultures of HepG2 hepatoma cells by measuring mitochondrial function (through lactate secretion), levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and levels of mitochondrial proteins COX II and COX IV. Furthermore, we tested the activity of ETV-triphosphate (ETV-TP) against mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (Pol gamma) in vitro. ETV concentrations as high as 100 times the maximal clinical exposure (C(max)) did not affect cell proliferation, levels of lactate, mitochondrial DNA, or mitochondrial proteins throughout the 15-day culture. The lack of mitochondrial toxicity was consistent with the finding that ETV-TP was not recognized by mitochondrial DNA Pol gamma and failed to be incorporated into DNA or inhibit the polymerase assay at the highest levels tested, 300 microM. Combinations of ETV with each of the other HBV NRTI antivirals, adefovir, tenofovir, and lamivudine at 10 times their respective C(max) levels also failed to result in cellular or mitochondrial toxicity. In summary, cell culture and enzymatic studies yielded no evidence that would predict mitochondrial toxicity of ETV at exposure levels in excess of those expected to be achieved clinically.",1
10721,10721,15500418,Risks of testosterone replacement therapy in ageing men,"Testosterone has been available to practitioners for several decades. However, testosterone prescriptions have increased in recent years partly because of the introduction of newer delivery systems that are topical and have good bioavailability. In the US alone, approximately 2 million prescriptions for testosterone were written in 2002. This represents a 30% increase from 2001 and a 170% increase from 1999. There has also been a 500% increase in prescription sales in the past 10 years. The rise in prescriptions may be in part due to the increasing recognition of hypogonadism in ageing males or andropause. Treatment relating to hypogonadism has relieved symptoms and improved the quality of life of many individuals. Epidemiological studies point toward an association with increased morbidity and mortality, with low testosterone states in ageing males. For example, there is a higher prevalence of depression, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, fracture rates, frailty and even dementia with low testosterone states. Recently, there have been some concerns raised regarding the long-term safety of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) from the Institute of Medicine. Current evidence suggests no causal relationship between prostate cancer and physiological dosing of testosterone, especially with careful selection and monitoring of patients. Cardiovascular risks have, overall, been neutral, although suggestions have been made that there are positive vasodilatory properties with testosterone. Mild eythrocytosis can be a common side effect of TRT, but thromboembolic events have rarely been reported in the literature. This paper addresses the evidence to date regarding the safety aspects of TRT. The medical-legal implications of TRT for men at this point in time is also discussed.",1

The aim of the Loire-Ardeche-Drome-Isere-Puy-de-Dome (LADIP) Trial of Atrial Flutter was 2-fold: (1) to prospectively compare first-line RFA (group I) versus cardioversion and amiodarone therapy (group II) after only 1 AFL episode; and (2) to determine the impact of both treatments on the long-term risk of subsequent atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: From October 2002 to February 2006, 104 patients (aged 78+/-5 years; 20 women) with AFL were included, with 52 patients in group I and 52 patients in group II. The cumulative risk of AFL or AF was interpreted with the use of Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by the log-rank test. Clinical presentation, echocardiographic data, and follow-up were as follows: age (78.5+/-5 versus 78+/-5 years), history of AF (27% versus 21.6%); structural heart disease (58% versus 65%), left ventricular ejection fraction (56+/-14% versus 54.5+/-14%), left atrial size (43+/-7 versus 43+/-6 mm), mean follow-up (13+/-6 versus 13+/-6 months; P=NS), recurrence of AFL (3.8% versus 29.5%; P<0.0001), and occurrence of significant AF beyond 10 minutes (25% versus 18%; P=0.3). Five complications (10%) were noted in group II (sick sinus syndrome in 2, hyperthyroidism in 1, and hypothyroidism in 2) and none in group I (0%) (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: RFA should be considered a first-line therapy even after the first episode of symptomatic AFL. There is a better long-term success rate, the same risk of subsequent AF, and fewer secondary effects.""",1
3258,3258,17202453,Dopamine agonists and the risk of cardiac-valve regurgitation,"BACKGROUND: Case reports and echocardiographic studies suggest that the ergot-derived dopamine agonists pergolide and cabergoline, used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and the restless legs syndrome, may increase the risk of cardiac-valve regurgitation. METHODS: We used data from the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database to identify a population-based cohort comprising 11,417 subjects 40 to 80 years of age who were prescribed antiparkinsonian drugs between 1988 and 2005. We conducted a nested case-control analysis within this cohort in which each patient with newly diagnosed cardiac-valve regurgitation was matched with up to 25 control subjects from the cohort, according to age, sex, and year of entry into the cohort. Incidence-rate ratios for cardiac-valve regurgitation with the use of different dopamine agonists were estimated by conditional logistic-regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 31 case patients with newly diagnosed cardiac-valve regurgitation, 6 were currently exposed to pergolide, 6 were currently exposed to cabergoline, and 19 had not been exposed to any dopamine agonist within the previous year. The rate of cardiac-valve regurgitation was increased with current use of pergolide (incidence-rate ratio, 7.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3 to 22.3) and cabergoline (incidence-rate ratio, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.5 to 15.6), but not with current use of other dopamine agonists. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, use of the dopamine agonists pergolide and cabergoline was associated with an increased risk of newly diagnosed cardiac-valve regurgitation.",0
10610,10610,15088997,Acute poisoning with autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale L.),"""INTRODUCTION: Colchicum autumnale, commonly known as the autumn crocus or meadow saffron, contains the antimitotic colchicine, which binds to tubulin and prevents it forming microtubules that are part of the cytoskeleton in all cells. CASE REPORT: A 71-year-old woman ate a plant she thought to be wild garlic (Allium ursinum). Ten hours later she arrived at the emergency department complaining of nausea, vomiting and watery diarrhea. Ingestion of a poisonous plant was suspected and she was treated with gastric lavage, oral activated charcoal and an infusion of normal saline. Toxicology analysis with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed colchicine in the patient's gastric lavage, blood (5 microg/l) and urine (30 microg/l). She developed arrhythmias, liver failure, pancreatitis, ileus, and bone marrow suppression with pancytopenia. Alopecia began in the third week. Treatment was supportive only. Five months later she had no clinical or laboratory signs of poisoning. DISCUSSION: The patient mistakenly ingested autumn crocus instead of wild garlic because of their great similarity. Colchicine primarily blocks mitosis in tissues with rapid cell turnover; this results in gastroenterocolitis in the first phase of colchicine poisoning, bone marrow hypoplasia with pancytopenia in the second and alopecia in the third, all of which were present in our patient. Colchicine toxicity in tissues without rapid cell turnover caused arrhythmias, acute liver failure and pancreatitis. CONCLUSION: Colchicine poisoning can result in gastroenterocolitis followed by multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. In unexplained gastroenterocolitis after ingestion of wild plants as a salad or spice, especially when wild garlic is mentioned, we should always consider autumn crocus. Diagnosis could be confirmed only by toxicology analyses. Management of colchicine poisoning is restricted to supportive therapy.""",1

Investigation demonstrated interstitial lung disease with bilateral infiltrates and unilateral effusion, as well as a severe chronic active hepatitis with marked fibrosis. Other notable features were positive antinuclear antibodies and anti-smooth-muscle antibodies and the absence of any possible cause except for nitrofurantoin treatment (Macrodantin, 100 mg/day), which the patient had been taking for the previous 3 years as a prophylactic measure against UTI. The patient died of pneumococcal septicemia less than 30 days after presentation. Pulmonary or hepatic injury caused by nitrofurantoin treatment is rare; their combined occurrence is hardly ever described.

8910,8910,7734010,Effect of lovastatin on early carotid atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Progression Study (ACAPS) Research Group,"""BACKGROUND: HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (or statins), a new class of lipid-lowering compounds, have raised expectations for more widespread use than that of the older lipid-lowering drugs. Not only are they more effective in lowering LDL cholesterol, but they are better tolerated as well. No data exist concerning the effect of statins on early carotid atherosclerosis and clinical events in men and women who have moderately elevated LDL cholesterol levels but are free of symptomatic cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lovastatin (20 to 40 mg/d) or its placebo was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial with factorial design along with warfarin (1 mg/d) or its placebo. This report is limited to the lovastatin component of the trial. Daily aspirin (81 mg/d) was recommended for everyone. Enrollment included 919 asymptomatic men and women, 40 to 79 years old, with early carotid atherosclerosis as defined by B-mode ultrasonography and LDL cholesterol between the 60th and 90th percentiles. The 3-year change in mean maximum intimal-medial thickness (IMT) in 12 walls of the carotid arteries was the primary outcome; change in single maximum IMT and incidence of major cardiovascular events were secondary outcomes. LDL cholesterol fell 28%, from 156.6 mg/dL at baseline to 113.1 mg/dL at 6 months (P < .0001), in the lovastatin groups and was largely unchanged in the lovastatin-placebo groups. Among participants not on warfarin, regression of the mean maximum IMT was seen after 12 months in the lovastatin group compared with the placebo group; the 3-year difference was statistically significant (P = .001). A larger favorable effect of lovastatin was observed for the change in single maximum IMT but was not statistically significant (P = .12). Five lovastatin-treated participants suffered major cardiovascular events--coronary heart disease mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke--versus 14 in the lovastatin-placebo groups (P = .04). One lovastatin-treated participant died, compared with eight on lovastatin-placebo (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: In men and women with moderately elevated LDL cholesterol, lovastatin reverses progression of IMT in the carotid arteries and appears to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events and mortality. Results from ongoing large-scale clinical trials may further establish the clinical benefit of statins.""",1

The decedent in the first case was a 36-year-old female found dead in bed in her secured home. She had a history of psychiatric illness, including paranoid disorder, depression with panic episodes, and post-traumatic stress disorder. She was treated with risperidone and sertraline. Nine months prior to her death, the decedent was also prescribed zolpidem (Ambien). The postmortem examination revealed white foam within the larynx and upper trachea, which is indicative of pulmonary edema. Toxicological analyses of the urine showed the presence of caffeine, risperidone, and zolpidem. Subsequent quantitation of postmortem iliac serum revealed 5.6 microg/L of 9-hydroxyrisperidone and the following zolpidem concentrations: blood (subclavian), 4.5 mg/L; blood (iliac), 7.7 mg/L; vitreous humor, 1.6 mg/L; bile, 8.9 mg/L; urine, 1.2 mg/L; liver, 22.6 mg/kg; and gastric contents, 42 mg. The second case involved a 58-year old female, also found dead in bed, with white foam around her mouth. The decedent had a 25-year history of hypertension and mental illness--manic depression and schizophrenia. She was medicated with carbamazepine, naproxen, risperidone, and zolpidem. The postmortem examination revealed cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, hepatomegaly, mild coronary atherosclerosis, and no signs of trauma. Toxicological analyses of the urine showed the presence of zolpidem and carbamazepine and metabolite. Zolpidem concentrations were as follows: blood (iliac), 1.6 mg/L; vitreous humor, 0.52 mg/L; bile, 2.6 mg/L; liver, 12 mg/kg; and gastric contents, 0.9 mg. The zolpidem blood concentrations of these cases are consistent with those of the previously published fatalities. The blood/vitreous humor ratios of zolpidem were 2.81 (subclavian) and 4.81 (iliac) in the first case and 3.08 (iliac) in the second case. These ratios, along with the sampling times of blood and vitreous humor for both cases, are not conclusive to indicate a definitive presence or absence of postmortem drug redistribution of zolpidem. The cause of death for both cases was determined to be acute zolpidem overdose, and manner of death was suicide.""",1

Correlation with light microscopic findings,"We used electron microscopy (EM) to analyze 52 biopsy samples from 22 patients who were receiving long-term weekly oral doses of methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Forty-eight biopsy samples were obtained after 2-6 years of continuous treatment, and 4 samples were obtained before treatment was begun. Specimens were graded for neutral fat, secondary and tertiary lysosomes, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) in hepatocytes, and for collagen in the perisinusoidal space (Disse's space). We examined the correlations between the EM findings and the light microscopic (LM) findings in the same biopsy specimens, and between the EM findings and the results of simultaneous monthly measures of aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and albumin levels, as well as history of alcohol consumption before MTX treatment and monthly assessments of clinical status during the course of treatment. The presence of collagen was minimally increased in these sequential biopsy samples, whereas fat, lysosomes, and SER were decreased. The SER decrease was statistically significant. EM findings of collagen in the space of Disse did not correlate with early fibrotic changes observed with LM. Thus, after as long as 6 years of weekly oral treatment with MTX, hepatic ultrastructural changes are minimal and are not clinically significant. The use of EM for sequential biopsy studies allows the quantitation of long-term hepatic changes that may be more limited than the impression gained after LM analysis.",1

The semiquantitative histological method showed a significant increase in pericellular collagen and in overall disease while morphometry showed a significant increase in pericellular, perivenular, and portal tract collagen. There was a significant correlation between the two methods, but morphometry had the advantage of objectivity and efficiency. There was no correlation between the increase in collagen and the accumulated dose of methotrexate, which suggests that other factors in addition to methotrexate may contribute to liver injury.",1

This study analysed 126 patients with relapsed, advanced stage follicular lymphoma who received BEAM (BCNU [carmustine], cytarabine, etoposide, melphalan)-alemtuzumab allogeneic HSCT (BEAM-allo) (n = 44) or BEAM-autologous HSCT (BEAM-auto) (n = 82). The BEAM-allo group had a younger median age (48 years vs. 56 years, P < 0.001) but received a higher median number of therapies pretransplant (P = 0.015) compared with the BEAM-auto group. There was a higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) in the BEAM-allo group compared with the BEAM-auto group at 1 year (20% vs. 2%, P = 0.001). Older age and heavily pretreated patients were associated with a higher NRM and poorer survival in the BEAM-allo group. There was, however, a significantly lower relapse rate (20% vs. 43%, P = 0.01) at 3 years with BEAM-alemtuzumab, with no relapses after 2 years, compared with a continued pattern of relapse in the autologous group. No difference in overall survival (OS) (P = 0.99) or disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.90) was identified at 3 years, whereas a plateau in OS and DFS with crossing of the survival curves in favour of BEAM-allo group was observed. Furthermore, the ability to re-induce remissions with donor leucocytes provides additional benefit in favour of allogeneic HSCT. ",0

In this review we examine the clinical presentation and management of UCDs with an emphasis on NAGS deficiency. An illustrative case is provided. Plasma ammonia levels should be measured in all adult patients with unexplained encephalopathy, as treatment can be potentially life-saving. Availability of N-carbamylglutamate (NCG; carglumic acid) has made protein restriction largely unnecessary in treatment regimens currently employed.

10270,10270,12691611,Liver failure caused by herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase plus ganciclovir therapy is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA depletion,"Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) converts ganciclovir (GCV) into an active compound, which can be incorporated into DNA molecules and terminate DNA synthesis. Gene transfer of HSV-tk followed by GCV administration has been used with success to treat experimental cancer and this strategy has entered into clinical trials. Although it is thought that the cytotoxic effect occurs mainly in tumoral dividing cells, where mitotic activity favors integration of the genotoxic compound into nuclear DNA, there are concerns of potential damage to normal nondividing cells. In the present work we have explored the mechanisms of HSV-tk/GCV toxicity and in particular whether this therapy may cause lesions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial dysfunction. We found that the administration of GCV to rats injected with adenovirus encoding HSV-tk induced hepatocellular damage characterized by the presence of apoptotic bodies, ballooning of hepatocytes, and severe hepatic steatosis with mitochondria enlargement and cristae dissolution at the ultrastructural level. Remarkably, Southern blot analysis showed substantial reduction in the amount of mtDNA in the liver. Using radiolabeled GCV we could demonstrate incorporation of this compound into both nuclear and mtDNA in HSV-tk-transduced rat hepatocytic cell line MCA-RH7777 and subsequent alteration of mitochondrial function. Our observations confirm that GCV can damage both nuclear and mtDNA in cells transduced with HSV-tk and that this effect could be responsible for severe mitochondrial dysfunction and toxicity in normal nondividing cells. These data are relevant for the design of clinical trials using adenoviral vectors encoding HSV-tk.",1

9082,9082,8357116,Levothyroxine therapy in patients with thyroid disease,"PURPOSE: To review the indications for and the proper monitoring of levothyroxine therapy in patients with thyroid disease. DATA SOURCES: Relevant English language articles published from 1966 to 1992 were identified through a MEDLINE search and manual searches of both identified articles and selected endocrinology texts. STUDY SELECTION: Studies, case reports, and review articles that contained data on the pathophysiologic aspects of relevant thyroid disorders and on the pharmacologic aspects of, indications for, and administration of levothyroxine therapy. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, complications, and treatment of thyroid disorders were analyzed with respect to patient selection, methods, diagnostic criteria, and conclusions. These data were used to develop a rational approach to the management of such patients. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Levothyroxine is a reliable and commonly prescribed drug to treat thyroid disease, but excessive dosage may have adverse effects. In patients with hypothyroidism, levothyroxine is used as replacement therapy. For most patients, therapy can be initiated with a full replacement dosage (1.6 micrograms/kg body weight), which is usually 75 to 100 micrograms/day for women and 100 to 150 micrograms/d for men. The goal is to normalize the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration. Levothyroxine is also used to suppress the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration. A trial of thyroid-stimulating hormone suppressive therapy is indicated for most patients with benign solitary nonfunctioning thyroid nodules and for those with a history of thyroid cancer. Levothyroxine in non-thyroid-stimulating hormone-suppressive doses may also be indicated for patients with nontoxic multinodular goiter and for certain patients after lobectomy for benign thyroid nodules. CONCLUSIONS: With proper patient monitoring, levothyroxine replacement therapy should be effective, inexpensive, and free of complications. Recommendations for thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression with levothyroxine are based on risk-benefit considerations of the biologic characteristics of the thyroid disorder and the individual patient.",1

Thus, the majority of FPHL patients remain untreated. Previously, we demonstrated that nonresponders to 5% minoxidil have low metabolism of minoxidil in hair follicles. As such, we hypothesized that increasing the dosage of topical minoxidil to low metabolizers would increase the number of responders without increasing the incidence of adverse events. In this study, we recruited FPHL subjects that were identified as non-responders to 5% topical minoxidil utilizing the previously validated assay for minoxidil response. Subjects were treated for 12 weeks with a novel 15% topical minoxidil solution. At 12 weeks, 60% of subjects achieved a clinically significant response based on target area hair counts (>13.7% from baseline), as well as significant improvement in global photographic assessment. None of the subjects experienced significant hemodynamic changes or any other adverse events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the potentially beneficial effect of a higher dosage of minoxidil in FPHL subjects who fail to respond to 5% minoxidil. ",0
2571,2571,12407597,Alcohol use and hepatitis C,"Excess alcohol consumption can worsen the course and outcome of chronic hepatitis C. It is important to distinguish between alcohol abuse, which must be treated on its own merits, and the effect of alcohol use on progression, severity, and treatment of hepatitis C. Most studies on the effects of alcohol on hepatitis C have focused on patients with high levels of daily alcohol intake. Indeed, the adverse effects of light and moderate amounts of alcohol intake on hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have not been clearly shown, and only limited studies have been performed. Sex differences exist in the effect of alcohol on fibrosis as well as on the severity of hepatitis C. Alcohol use has been reported to be associated with lower responses to therapy and, in some studies, higher HCV RNA levels and increased HCV quasi-species. Few studies address the treatment of hepatitis C in the alcoholic individual or determine the effect of continued light or moderate alcohol use on the outcome of treatment response. In summary, many critical questions remain regarding the interactions between alcohol and hepatitis C. Currently, the evidence from the literature shows that heavy alcohol intake worsens the outcome of HCV infection. The literature is inadequate to provide definitive recommendations regarding the effect of light to moderate alcohol use in patients with hepatitis C.",0

5372,5372,25400619,Conceptualizing lennox-gastaut syndrome as a secondary network epilepsy,"""Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a category of severe, disabling epilepsy, characterized by frequent, treatment-resistant seizures, and cognitive impairment. Electroencephalography (EEG) shows characteristic generalized epileptic activity that is similar in those with lesional, genetic, or unknown causes, suggesting a common underlying mechanism. The condition typically begins in young children, leaving many severely disabled with recurring seizures throughout their adult life. Scalp EEG of the tonic seizures of LGS is characterized by a diffuse high-voltage slow transient evolving into generalized low-voltage fast activity, likely reflecting sustained fast neuronal firing over a wide cortical area. The typical interictal discharges (runs of slow spike-and-wave and bursts of generalized paroxysmal fast activity) also have a """"generalized"""" electrical field, suggesting widespread cortical involvement. Recent brain mapping studies have begun to reveal which cortical and subcortical regions are active during these """"generalized"""" discharges. In this critical review, we examine findings from neuroimaging studies of LGS and place these in the context of the electrical and clinical features of the syndrome. We suggest that LGS can be conceptualized as """"secondary network epilepsy,"""" where the epileptic activity is expressed through large-scale brain networks, particularly the attention and default-mode networks. Cortical lesions, when present, appear to chronically interact with these networks to produce network instability rather than triggering each individual epileptic discharge. LGS can be considered as """"secondary"""" network epilepsy because the epileptic manifestations of the disorder reflect the networks being driven, rather than the specific initiating process. In this review, we begin with a summation of the clinical manifestations of LGS and what this has revealed about the underlying etiology of the condition. We then undertake a systematic review of the functional neuroimaging literature in LGS, which leads us to conclude that LGS can best be conceptualized as """"secondary network epilepsy.""""  """,0

We used logistic-regression models to estimate the relative risks of disease-specific types of chronic renal failure associated with the use of various analgesics RESULTS: Aspirin and acetaminophen were used regularly by 37 percent and 25 percent, respectively, of the patients with renal failure and by 19 percent and 12 percent, respectively, of the controls. Regular use of either drug in the absence of the other was associated with an increase by a factor of 2.5 in the risk of chronic renal failure from any cause. The relative risks rose with increasing cumulative lifetime doses, rose more consistently with acetaminophen use than with aspirin use, and were increased for most disease-specific types of chronic renal failure. When we disregarded the recent use of analgesics, which could have occurred in response to antecedents of renal disease, the associations were only slightly attenuated CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with the existence of exacerbating effects of acetaminophen and aspirin on chronic renal failure. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of bias due to the triggering of analgesic consumption by predisposing conditions.",0

Carriers of the hepatitis B virus are likely to have some degree of liver damage due to their chronic infection. We hypothesized that prophylactic treatment of carriers with isoniazid would cause greater liver damage, as measured by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, than would such therapy of noncarriers. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of the southeast Asian refugee population in Philadelphia failed to support this hypothesis. Isoniazid did not cause greater hepatotoxicity in hepatitis B carriers than in noncarriers. Although carriers had higher ALT levels than noncarriers, both groups experienced transient ALT elevations during the first 2 months of isoniazid prophylactic therapy. Therefore, we concluded that chronic infection with hepatitis B virus is not a contraindication to the prophylactic use of isoniazid.",1

Preoperative methods to estimate SI are lacking. The aim of this study was to identify SI by evaluating portal vein haemodynamics. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging flowmetry (MRIF) was used to estimate portal vein haemodynamics in 29 patients with CRLM before liver surgery. Sinusoidal injury was evaluated from resected non-tumorous liver parenchyma according to the combined vascular injury (CVI) score of ?3. RESULTS: All patients with SI (six of 29) received oxaliplatin; however, a significant association could not be proven (P= 0.148). Oxaliplatin-treated patients showed portal vein dilatation in both the SI and non-SI groups compared with patients who had not received oxaliplatin (Bonferroni corrected P= 0.003 and P= 0.039, respectively). Mean portal velocity tended to be lower in patients with SI compared with oxaliplatin-treated patients without SI (Bonferroni corrected P= 0.087). A mean portal velocity of ?14.35?cm/s together with a cross-section area of ?1.55?cm(2) was found to predict SI with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 78%. CONCLUSIONS: Oxaliplatin treatment was associated with portal vein dilatation. Patients with SI showed a tendency towards decreased mean portal flow velocity. This may indicate that SI is associated with an increased resistance to blood flow in the liver parenchyma. Portal vein haemodynamic variables estimated by MRIF can identify patients without SI non-invasively.""",1

13758,13758,25895618,Recent advances in the treatment of hyperammonemia,"Ammonia is a neurotoxic agent that is primarily generated in the intestine and detoxified in the liver. Toxic increases in systemic ammonia levels predominantly result from an inherited or acquired impairment in hepatic detoxification and lead to potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric symptoms. Inborn deficiencies in ammonia detoxification mainly affect the urea cycle, an endogenous metabolic removal system in the liver. Hepatic encephalopathy, on the other hand, is a hyperammonemia-related complication secondary to acquired liver function impairment. A range of therapeutic options is available to target either ammonia generation and absorption or ammonia removal. Therapies for hepatic encephalopathy decrease intestinal ammonia production and uptake. Treatments for urea cycle disorders eliminate ammoniagenic amino acids through metabolic transformation, preventing ammonia generation. Therapeutic approaches removing ammonia activate the urea cycle or the second essential endogenous ammonia detoxification system, glutamine synthesis.

A significant difference favoring ETV was reached at day 10 (day 10 ETV-ADV difference estimate: -0.66 log(10) copies/mL; 95% CI [-0.30, -0.01]). Early virological response was found to be predictive of subsequent virological response, with those having lower HBV DNA levels at day 10 being more likely to achieve HBV DNA of less than 300 copies/mL at week 48. In addition, there was considerably less variability in the extent of HBV DNA reductions in patients treated with entecavir versus adefovir. Both the mean decrease in serum HBV DNA and the proportion of patients achieving HBV DNA less than 300 copies/mL were greater in entecavir-treated than adefovir-treated patients at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48. At week 48, one (3%) ETV-treated versus 15 (47%) ADV-treated patients had HBV DNA of 10(5) copies/mL or more. Both antivirals were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Entecavir therapy resulted in earlier and superior reduction in HBV DNA compared with adefovir in nucleoside-na?ve HBeAg-positive patients with CHB.",0

36,36,228409,Acute nephritis and allergic vasculitis due to phenindione (author's transl)],The authors report a case of acute nephritis which appears during a treatment with phenindione. The nephropathy described after this medication are now well known. Their manifestations are either a proteinuria associated or not with a nephrotic syndrome or an interstitial nephritis whose pronostic is reserved. In this observation the mechanism is different : the lesion is glomerular and complicates an allergic vasculitis which was secondary to the phenindione's therapy. The pronostic was good. ,0

Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist used to treat AD in > 80 countries worldwide, and studies in the USA and Europe have shown it to be effective in improving language deficits; however, there are currently no data on language improvements in Japanese patients treated with memantine. OBJECTIVES: To clarify the efficacy and safety of memantine in Japanese outpatients with moderate to severe AD, using a pooled analysis of two multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trials, a phase 2 dose-finding study and a phase 3 study. RESULTS: The final analysis comprised 633 patients (318 receiving memantine and 315 placebo). Memantine produced better outcomes in terms of Severe Impairment Battery-Japanese version, Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus-Japanese version, Behavioral Pathology in AD Rating Scale, and language scores, versus placebo. The overall incidence of adverse events and adverse reactions was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: In this pooled analysis of Japanese patients, memantine achieved better outcomes than placebo in terms of cognition, including attention, praxis, visuospatial ability and language, and behavioral and psychological symptoms, including activity disturbances and aggressiveness.""",1

However, the excess was not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). The observed and expected numbers of breast-cancer cases were the same, but four lung-cancer cases were observed, whereas 0.6 would have been expected. This finding is confounded by the fact that all four lung cancers developed in women who were smokers. Overall, we observed no appreciable increase in cases of cancer.",0

A total of 37 phenotypically and/or genotypically confirmed M. tuberculosis rifampin-resistant clinical isolates were included in this study. The strains were selected from symptomatic patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. A line probe assay kit (INNO-LiPA rif Tb) was used for any specific mutational pattern of rpoB gene. Our data support the common notion that rifampin resistance genotypes with mutation at a critical codon, i.e. the one encoding Ser-531, is frequent in M. tuberculosis populations regardless of geographic origin. Our findings also suggest that in a geographic area such as Eastern Poland less common mutations of the rpoB gene occur more frequently. The frequency of substitution at codon 526 (His-Asp) was found to be high in Lublin. This study indicates that mutations associated with nucleotide replacements in codons 526 (His-Asp) and 531 (Ser-Leu) were associated with a high percentage of RMP resistance, whereas mutations in codons 516 (Asp-Val) and 526 (His-Tyr) were observed in a low percentage of RMP-resistance.

First, we constructed BioCaP with SIM internally incorporated (SIM-BioCaP). Then we characterized the morphology and chemical composition of SIM-BioCaP. The release kinetics of SIM was monitored in vitro spectroscopically. Thereafter, we explored the in-vitro cellular responses of hASCs to SIM-BioCaP by performing scanning electron microscopy observation, proliferation assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay, alizarin red staining and real-time PCR. Finally, we investigated the in-vivo osteogenic activities of the novel TEB in a subcutaneous bone induction model in nude mice. We found that SIM was successfully incorporated internally in BioCaP and showed a slow release manner without significantly affecting the attachment and proliferation of hASCs. The released SIM from BioCaP could significantly enhance the proliferation, ALP activities, mineralized nodules formation and osteogenic genes of hASCs. The in-vivo tests showed this TEB could induce new bone formation while the other groups could not. Taken together, the present data show that this novel TEB represented a very promising construct to treat critical-volume bone defects. ",0

This study uses the case-referent (case-control) technique and is concerned with workers in a copper smelter in a complex work environment, characterised by the presence of trivalent arsenic in combination with sulphur dioxide and copper, and also with other agents. Lung cancer mortality was found to be increased about five-fold and cardiovascular disease about two-fold, showing a dose-response relationship to arsenic exposure. Mortality from malignant blood disease (leukaemia and myeloma) and cirrhosis of the liver was also slightly increased. This mortality pattern among the smelter workers is consistent with earlier reports. An increased mortality from cardiovascular disease in this type of industry is of particular interest as it has been reported only once before.",1

9174,9174,8667468,"Increased matrix proteins, collagen and transforming growth factor are early markers of hepatotoxicity in patients on long-term methotrexate therapy","BACKGROUND: Hepatotoxicity, which may lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis, often limits the use of long-term low dose methotrexate for psoriasis and autoimmune diseases. Standard light microscopy lacks sensitivity for early fibrosis. DESIGN: This is a retrospective study of immunohistochemical markers of early fibrosis including laminin and fibronectin, collagen deposition and lipocyte activation in hepatic biopsies of 36 psoriatic patients treated with methotrexate for one to five years, at an average dose of 20 mg/week. Biopsies before initiation of methotrexate (n = 36) showed minimal immunohistochemical expression of desmin, transforming growth factor alpha, matrix proteins, and collagen. Expression of laminin, fibronectin, collagens III and IV increased significantly and progressively over baseline values after cumulative doses of 1.5 +/- 0.25 g (n = 20) and 3 +/- 0.5 g methotrexate, respectively. Increases in desmin, smooth muscle actin and collagen type I also occurred but the changes were less consistent. Light microscopic abnormalities of hepatotoxicity were not detectable in any of these biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical quantification of matrix proteins and collagens type III and IV may be early, sensitive and dose responsive markers of methotrexate hepatotoxicity which progress with increasing cumulative doses of methotrexate.",1

METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long-term safety extension study, nonhysterectomized women aged 40 to 80 years (n = 180) received daily oral doses of placebo, ospemifene 30 mg/day, or ospemifene 60 mg/day for 40 weeks (continued as blinded treatments from the initial 12-week pivotal efficacy study of ospemifene). The total treatment period was 52 weeks. Safety assessments included adverse events, cervical Papanicolaou tests, endometrial histology, endometrial thickness, gynecological examination, breast palpation, mammography, physical examination, and clinical safety laboratory assessments. RESULTS: No clinically significant adverse changes in safety assessments were observed in any treatment group. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Hot flushes, the most frequently occurring treatment-emergent adverse event related to the study drug, had a low discontinuation rate (1.6%). No study participants discontinued because of endometrial or cervical pathology; no endometrial findings were clinically meaningful. On week 52, more than 95% of endometrial biopsy samples either were classified as atrophic or inactive or had insufficient tissue for diagnosis. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events of pelvic organ prolapse or venous thromboembolism. No cases of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma were observed. Only three participants (1.7%) taking ospemifene experienced vaginal bleeding or spotting, which was self-limiting. CONCLUSIONS: Daily doses of ospemifene 30 mg and ospemifene 60 mg yielded few treatment-emergent adverse events and demonstrated no significant endometrial changes during the 1-year treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with a uterus.""",1

AIMS: To examine associations between kava use and potential health effects. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out within a kava-using east Arnhem Land Aboriginal community in tropical northern Australia. One-hundred-and-one adults who were current, recent or non-users of kava were enrolled in March 2000. Main outcome measures were physical, anthropometric, biochemical, haematological, immunological and neurocognitive assessments. RESULTS: Kava users more frequently showed a characteristic dermopathy (P<0.001). They had increased levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase (P<0.001). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in kava users (P<0.001). Fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and neurocognitive tests were not different between kava use categories. IgE and IgG antibodies were elevated across the whole group, as were C-reactive protein and homocysteine. CONCLUSIONS: Kava use was associated with dermopathy, liver function abnormalities and decreased lymphocytes. If kava continues to be used by Aboriginal populations, monitoring should focus on the health consequences of these findings, including a possible increase in serious infections. The interaction between kava, alcohol and other substances requires further study. Although markers of cardiovascular risk are increased across the population, these were not higher in kava users, and this increase may be linked to the large infectious pathogen burden reflective of the socioeconomic disadvantage seen in many remote Aboriginal communities.",1

To address industry-perceived barriers to such access, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed a model drug facts label for such sales to assess whether consumers understood the key statements for safe and effective use. METHODS: In this label-comprehension study, we conducted individual structured interviews with 710 adults and adolescents, including 430 adults who use opioids and their family and friends. Eight primary end points were developed to assess user comprehension of each of the key steps in the label. Each of these end points included a prespecified target threshold ranging from 80 to 90% that was evaluated through a comparison of the lower boundary of the 95% exact confidence interval. RESULTS: The results for performance on six primary end points met or exceeded thresholds, including the steps """"Check for a suspected overdose"""" (threshold, 85%; point estimate [PE], 95.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 94.0 to 97.1) and """"Give the first dose"""" (threshold, 85%; PE, 98.2%; 95% CI, 96.9 to 99.0). The lower boundaries for four other primary end points ranged from 88.8 to 94.0%. One exception was comprehension of """"Call 911 immediately,"""" but this instruction closely approximated the target of 90% (PE, 90.3%; 95% CI, 87.9 to 92.4). Another exception was comprehension of the composite step of """"Check, give, and call 911 immediately"""" (threshold, 85%; PE, 81.1%; 95% CI, 78.0 to 83.9).

4149,4149,20949553,Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1b2 (Oatp1b2) is important for the hepatic uptake of unconjugated bile acids: Studies in Oatp1b2-null mice,"The organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1b family (Oatp1b2 in rodents and OATP1B1/1B3 in humans) is liver-specific and transports various chemicals into the liver. However, the role of the Oatp1b family in the hepatic uptake of bile acids (BAs) into the liver is unknown. Therefore, in Oatp1b2-null mice, the concentrations of BAs in plasma, liver, and bile were compared with wild-type (WT) mice. It was first determined that livers of the Oatp1b2-null mice were not compensated by altered expression of other hepatic transporters. However, the messenger RNA of Cyp7a1 was 70% lower in the Oatp1b2-null mice. Increased expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 in intestines of Oatp1b2-null mice might be responsible for decreased hepatic expression of Cyp7a1 in Oatp1b2-null mice. The hepatic concentration and biliary excretion of conjugated and unconjugated BAs were essentially the same in Oatp1b2-null and WT mice. The serum concentration of taurine-conjugated BAs was essentially the same in the two genotypes. In contrast, the serum concentrations of unconjugated BAs were 3-45 times higher in Oatp1b2-null than WT mice. After intravenous administration of cholate to Oatp1b2-null mice, its clearance was 50% lower than in WT mice, but the clearance of taurocholate was similar in the two genotypes. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that Oatp1b2 has a major role in the hepatic uptake of unconjugated BAs.",0

Forty-two patients(M:F = 30:12; mean age, 59.9 years) with liver metastases from colorectal cancer were treated with HAI using a totally implantable vascular access port system from July 1994 to March 1999. The regimen used here was so-called weekly high-dose 5-fluorouracil(5-FU) infusion(5-FU, 1,000 mg/m2/week). Volume measurement of the liver demonstrated not only whole liver atrophy including the tumor but also volume reduction of the non-tumorous lobe. Atrophic change of the liver was seen in patients who were administered over 20 g/m2 of 5-FU(p < 0.01). The CT attenuation values of the liver were examined, and fatty infiltration was seen in six patients. Histologic examination of liver biopsies from the non-tumorous part revealed steatosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the portal triad, which were not seen in specimens prior to HAI. On clinical laboratory findings, enzymes representing bile duct, including alkaline phosphatase, leucine amino peptidase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, were increased in 22 patients. In terms of regional toxicity for long-term HAI, 20 g/m2 of 5-FU, is the key dose at which to consider temporary cessation or dose reduction.""",1

The purpose of the study was to determine whether the use of a backrest resulted in greater force than when not using a backrest when the angle of back inclination was held constant and the support was varied. The results indicated that the addition of a backrest, when the body assumes an optimal position, enables the knee extensors to generate greater force then when no backrest is used. A backrest adds to the comfort and support of the subject performing resistive knee exercise and should be incorporated into the design of knee exercise units.",1
10011,10011,11778670,Hepatotoxicity in acute iron poisoning,"Although hepatotoxicity is a known sequela of acute iron poisoning, the literature describing it is confined to sporadic reports. Key issues such as prognosis and whether this is a dose-related phenomenon are not addressed. Review of this literature and of experimental animal studies demonstrates that it occurs early in the clinical course and has a relatively high mortality. The lowest acute serum iron concentration associated with hepatotoxicity was 1700 microg/dL (304 micromol/L). Since this greatly exceeds the reference range of 50-150 microg/dL (9-27 micromol/L), it supports a dose-related etiology. Unlike most other hepatotoxins, the periportal areas of the hepatic lobule are the primary sites of injury. As this is the principle sitefor hepatic regeneration, this accountsfor the relatively high mortality rate. An understanding of the pathogenesis of the hepatotoxicity of acute iron poisoning is central to the identification of rational and effective interventions. From the clinical perspective, the relatively high mortality rate of iron poisoning-induced hepatotoxicity requires vigilance for its onset and earlier consideration of liver transplantation.",1
4438,4438,23504650,Incidence and prevalence of hepatitis C in prisons and other closed settings: results of a systematic review and meta-analysis,"People detained in prisons and other closed settings are at elevated risk of infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis with the aim of determining the rate of incident HCV infection and the prevalence of anti-HCV among detainees in closed settings. We systematically searched databases of peer-reviewed literature and widely distributed a call for unpublished data. We calculated summary estimates of incidence and prevalence among general population detainees and detainees with a history of injection drug use (IDU), and explored heterogeneity through stratification and meta-regression. The summary prevalence estimates were used to estimate the number of anti-HCV positive prisoners globally. HCV incidence among general detainees was 1.4 per 100 person-years (py; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1, 2.7; k?=?4), and 16.4 per 100 py (95% CI: 0.8, 32.1; k?=?3) among detainees with a history of IDU. The summary prevalence estimate of anti-HCV in general detainees was 26% (95% CI: 23%, 29%; k?=?93), and in detainees with a history of IDU, 64% (95% CI: 58%, 70%; k?=?51). The regions of highest prevalence were Central Asia (38%; 95% CI 32%, 43%; k?=?1) and Australasia (35%; 95% CI: 28%, 43%; k?=?9). We estimate that 2.2 million (range: 1.4-2.9 million) detainees globally are anti-HCV positive, with the largest populations in North America (668,500; range: 553,500-784,000) and East and Southeast Asia (638,000; range: 332,000-970,000). CONCLUSION: HCV is a significant concern in detained populations, with one in four detainees anti-HCV-positive. Epidemiological data on the extent of HCV infection in detained populations is lacking in many countries. Greater attention towards prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HCV infection among detained populations is urgently required.",0
1788,1788,8678931,An analysis of the lowest effective intensity of prophylactic anticoagulation for patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: To avert major hemorrhage, physicians need to know the lowest intensity of anticoagulation that is effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Since the low rate of stroke has made it difficult to perform prospective studies to resolve this issue, we conducted a case-control study. METHODS: We studied 74 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation who were admitted to our hospital from 1989 through 1994 after having an ischemic stroke while taking warfarin. For each patient with stroke, three controls with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation who were treated as outpatients were randomly selected from the 1994 registry of the anticoagulant-therapy unit (222 controls). We used the international normalized ratio (INR) to measure the intensity of anticoagulation. For the patients with stroke, we used INR at admission; for the controls, we selected the INR that was measured closest to the month and day of the matched case patient's hospital admission. RESULTS: The risk of stroke rose steeply at INRs below 2.0. At an INR of 1.7, the adjusted odds ratio for stroke, as compared with the risk at an INR of 2.0, was 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 2.4); at an INR of 1.5, it was 3.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.4 to 4.6); and at an INR of 1.3, it was 6.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.6 to 9.8). Other independent risk factors were previous stroke (odds ratio, 10.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.4 to 24.5), diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 2.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 6.5), hypertension (odds ratio, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 5.7), and current smoking (odds ratio, 5.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 24.0). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with atrial fibrillation, anticoagulant prophylaxis is effective at INRs of 2.0 or greater. Since previous studies have indicated that the risk of hemorrhage rises rapidly at INRs greater than 4.0 to 5.0, tight control of anticoagulant therapy to maintain the INR between 2.0 and 3.0 is a better strategy than targeting lower, less effective levels of anticoagulation.",0
7199,7199,615837,Hyperplasia and prolapse of hepatocytes into hepatic veins during longterm methyltestosterone therapy: possible relationships of these changes to the developement of peliosis hepatis and liver tumours,"We report the pathological changes in liver biopsies from 10 patients (four female transexuals and six impotent males) after treatment with 150 mg methyltestosterone daily for periods of up to 3 years, and in a hemihepatectomy specimen from a female transexual who developed a liver adenoma after 37 months of this treatment. Hepatocyte hyperplasia and mild focal sinusoidal dilatation was found in most cases. In some cases there were microcysts and dissociation of hepatocytes. In nine patients there was accumulation of hepatocytes between the endothelium and the supporting collagen of hepatic veins which often resulted in either partial occlusion of their lumina or disruption of their walls. These vascular changes do not appear to have been reported before. It is postulated that a single pathological process-hyperplasia, perhaps related to the anabolic effect of methyltestosterone--could be partly responsible both for the formation of cysts through mechanical obstruction of hepatic veins and for the formation of nodules and tumours.",1

Cases were clustered in the winter and spring with the peak in February and March. These coincided with the occurrence of influenza and, numerically, were associated more closely with influenza B than with influenza A. Six of the 58 cases were associated with chickenpox. Twenty-six children with RS were seen from 1963 to 1971, before the beginning of a systematic epidemiologic and virologic study. Viral infection was documented in either the patient or a contact in only 19% of those studied. Between 1971 and 1973, after the study was initiated, 16 cases of RS were diagnosed and viral infection was confirmed in 56% of these. In 1974, an epidemic of RS occurred during an influenza B epidemic and viral infection was found in either the patient or a contact in 81% of 16 cases. This study demonstrates that an association with viral infection can be proven in the majority of cases of RS when an intensive investigation is undertaken. During this study no significant environmental toxic exposures could be idenified. Most children had taken aspirin and other medications, and seven children had a history of excessive aspirin ingestion.",1

One hundred fourteen patients received rifampin/pyrazinamide in Wake County, North Carolina, between December 1999 and May 2002; 60.5% of these patients were homeless, and at least 17% drank alcohol to excess. Seventy-seven patients (67.5%) completed a full 2-month course. Nine patients had a history of viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease. Four of 114 (3.5%; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-8.7%) patients developed hepatitis on therapy, and another two had symptoms consistent with hepatitis but did not report for laboratory testing (total confirmed plus suspected hepatitis rate 5.3%; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-11.1%). No patient who developed hepatitis had a history of viral hepatitis or liver disease, and none had been previously treated with isoniazid. No patients died or were hospitalized due to drug side effects. Rifampin/pyrazinamide was associated with a significantly higher rate of hepatitis than previously described with isoniazid therapy for latent tuberculosis but resulted in a high completion rate. The rifampin/pyrazinamide regimen for latent tuberculosis infection may be useful for high-risk, traditionally nonadherent patient groups, but careful monitoring for toxicity is required.""",1

METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned 278 patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension (either idiopathic or associated with connective-tissue disease or with repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts) to placebo or sildenafil (20, 40, or 80 mg) orally three times daily for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 12 in the distance walked in six minutes. The change in mean pulmonary-artery pressure and World Health Organization (WHO) functional class and the incidence of clinical worsening were also assessed, but the study was not powered to assess mortality. Patients completing the 12-week randomized study could enter a long-term extension study. RESULTS: The distance walked in six minutes increased from baseline in all sildenafil groups; the mean placebo-corrected treatment effects were 45 m (+13.0 percent), 46 m (+13.3 percent), and 50 m (+14.7 percent) for 20, 40, and 80 mg of sildenafil, respectively (P<0.001 for all comparisons). All sildenafil doses reduced the mean pulmonary-artery pressure (P=0.04, P=0.01, and P<0.001, respectively), improved the WHO functional class (P=0.003, P<0.001, and P<0.001, respectively), and were associated with side effects such as flushing, dyspepsia, and diarrhea. The incidence of clinical worsening did not differ significantly between the patients treated with sildenafil and those treated with placebo. Among the 222 patients completing one year of treatment with sildenafil monotherapy, the improvement from baseline at one year in the distance walked in six minutes was 51 m. CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil improves exercise capacity, WHO functional class, and hemodynamics in patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension.",0

Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate (PHEN/TPM CR), as an adjunct to lifestyle modification, has previously shown significant weight loss compared with placebo in a 56-wk study in overweight and obese subjects with ?2 weight-related comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of PHEN/TPM CR in overweight and obese subjects with cardiometabolic disease. DESIGN: This was a placebo-controlled, double-blind, 52-wk extension study; volunteers at selected sites continued with original randomly assigned treatment [placebo, 7.5 mg phentermine/46 mg controlled-release topiramate (7.5/46), or 15 mg phentermine/92 mg controlled-release topiramate (15/92)] to complete a total of 108 wk. All subjects participated in a lifestyle-modification program. RESULTS: Of 866 eligible subjects, 676 (78%) elected to continue in the extension. Overall, 84.0% of subjects completed the study, with similar completion rates between treatment groups. At week 108, PHEN/TPM CR was associated with significant, sustained weight loss (intent-to-treat with last observation carried forward; P < 0.0001 compared with placebo); least-squares mean percentage changes from baseline in body weight were -1.8%, -9.3%, and -10.5% for placebo, 7.5/46, and 15/92, respectively. Significantly more PHEN/TPM CR-treated subjects at each dose achieved ?5%, ?10%, ?15%, and ?20% weight loss compared with placebo (P < 0.001). PHEN/TPM CR improved cardiovascular and metabolic variables and decreased rates of incident diabetes in comparison with placebo. PHEN/TPM CR was well tolerated over 108 wk, with reduced rates of adverse events occurring between weeks 56 and 108 compared with rates between weeks 0 and 56. CONCLUSION: PHEN/TPM CR in conjunction with lifestyle modification may provide a well-tolerated and effective option for the sustained treatment of obesity complicated by cardiometabolic disease.

When tests for these common infectious etiologies are negative, many clinicians are unsure of which diagnoses to consider, resulting in delayed treatment. The authors analyzed the diagnoses associated with hypoglycorrhachia to determine their relative frequencies at our institution and summarized all the diagnoses associated with hypoglycorrhachia in the literature. Retrospective analysis of adults with hypoglycorrhachia at a tertiary care teaching hospital over a 5-year period. Inclusion criteria included CSF glucose <40 mg/dL and age 18 years or older. Exclusion criteria included CSF/serum glucose ≥0.6. Eighty-nine unique hypoglycorrhachia episodes were identified. The most common etiologies among all episodes of hypoglycorrhachia were bacterial meningitis (24%), fungal meningitis (15%), stroke/bleed (13%), malignancy (11%), viral meningitis (6%), neurosarcoidosis (4%), neurosyphilis (4%) and cerebral toxoplasmosis (3%). The most common etiology was fungal meningitis (38%) among HIV-infected patients and bacterial meningitis (62%) among neurosurgery patients. However, in patients without HIV or neurosurgical history, noninfectious etiologies (stroke/bleed, 24%; malignancy, 22%) were most common. Many diagnoses, both infectious and noninfectious, lead to hypoglycorrhachia and must be considered in the differential diagnosis. ",0

Liver functions deteriorated 1 to 2 wk after withdrawal of the steroid therapy and liver failure occurred. Steroid readministration and intensive therapy for liver failure did not prevent death. An excessive immune response provoked by steroid withdrawal and decreased reserve capacity due to underlying chronic liver disease were thought to be factors in the liver failure. Caution must be exercised in the administration of steroids to patients with underlying chronic HBV infection to prevent exacerbation of hepatitis. Prompt readministration of steroids is indicated if evidence of liver failure develops.,1

9298,9298,9134282,Double-blind randomized multicenter study on the efficacy of trapidil versus isosorbide dinitrate in stable angina pectoris,"BACKGROUND: Trapidil is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase I-IV with resulting positive lusitropic, vasodilating, and antiplatelet effects. HYPOTHESIS: This study was undertaken to compare the antianginal efficacy of trapidil with that of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) in patients with stable angina pectoris. METHODS: We studied 95 patients with stable angina pectoris who were randomized into a double-blind parallel group study with either oral trapidil or ISDN. After a 1-week run-in period and a 2-week wash-out phase, the patients received either trapidil 200 mg t.i.d. (n = 48) or ISDN 20 mg t.i.d. (n = 47) for 12 weeks. All antianginal medication, except sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), was discontinued during the study. Patients underwent an exercise electrocardiogram on an ergometer bicycle according to a modified Bruce protocol before and at 6 and 12 weeks during treatment. RESULTS: The workload capacity increased from 583 +/- 281 W.min before treatment to 833 +/- 444 W.min after 12 weeks of treatment in the trapidil group (p < 0.01) and from 555 +/- 276 W.min to 827 +/- 361 W.min in the ISDN group (p < 0.01). The anginal attacks per week as well as the use of GTN decreased significantly in both groups. After 12 weeks of therapy, the cumulative ST-segment depression during exercise decreased by 67% in the trapidil patients and by 23% in the ISDN patients. Compared with baseline, the double product at the 75 W level was reduced in both groups after 12 weeks of treatment. Blood pressure and heart rate at rest remained nearly unchanged. Overall, no statistical difference was found between the two study groups. The tolerability was good. CONCLUSION: Oral trapidil therapy is safe and effective in stable angina pectoris and is equivalent to standard therapy with ISDN.",1

The IC50 value of IVR was measured in vitro as low as 0.81 ± 0.03 μM, and its inhibition type was suggested as competitive according to the Lineweaver-Burk plot. This peptide can be generated from either thermolysin followed by trypsin digestion (two stages) or only trypsin digestion (one stage). Quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis indicated that two-stage digestion gave 3.14 ± 0.17 mg of IVR from 1 g of SSTEW, better than that from one-stage digestion (1.31 ± 0.12 mg). In vivo antihypertensive activity of the tripeptide IVR after single oral administration (0.1 and 1 mg/kg of body weight) led to a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure 2-4 h after administration in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In addition, the binding mechanism of IVR has been rationalized through docking simulations using the testicular ACE (tACE)-lisinopril complex at 2 Å resolution (PDB 108A ). The best docking pose was located at the tACE catalytic site resembling the mode of inhibition exerted by lisinopril, an effective hypertensive synthetic drug. The degree of inhibition of this peptide correlated with the H-bond interaction between the C-terminal of IVR and Lys511 and Tyr520 residues of tACE, a significant inhibitor registration for lisinopril. This study illustrated that IVR behaves as a transition-state analogue inhibitor and is useful in therapeutic intervention for blood pressure control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an efficient ACE-inhibitory tripeptide generated from the unfertilized egg of soft-shelled turtle.  ",0

The aim of this study is to evaluate the cytotoxic potentials of CBZ in human colon cancer cells (HT-29 cells). HT-29 cells were treated with 36 and 76 μg/ml of CBZ for 24 h. The cytotoxic effect was evaluated by MTT assay. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) expression was evaluated through dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate staining. Morphological changes related to apoptosis were evaluated by dual staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide. Mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated by rhodamine 123 staining. Immunofluorescence analysis of caspase 3 was done with confocal microscopy. CBZ caused significant cytotoxicity in HT-29 cells and the effect was concentration dependent. CBZ treatments also caused significant expression of ROS in HT-29 cells. Dual staining showed early and late apoptotic cells and morphological alterations induced by the CBZ. Confocal microscopic studies confirmed the increased caspase 3 expression in CBZ-treated cells. CBZ induced apoptosis in HT-29 cell through ROS generation and caspase 3 expression and these results pave the way for further in vivo studies. ,0

3116,3116,16507146,Cytokine polymorphisms influence treatment outcomes in SLE patients treated with antimalarial drugs,"Antimalarial agents have been widely used as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other rheumatological diseases, although their mechanism of action has not yet been fully defined. It is known, however, that effective response to treatment is variable among patients. Thus, the identification of genetic predictors of treatment response would provide valuable information for therapeutic intervention. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of antimalarial treatment on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha serum levels and evaluate the possible influence of TNFalpha and IL-10 functional genetic polymorphisms on the response to antimalarial drugs. To this end, TNFalpha serum levels were quantified in 171 SLE patients and 215 healthy controls by ELISA techniques and polymorphisms at positions -1,082 and -308 of the IL-10 and TNFalpha gene promoters were determined by PCR amplification followed by hybridization with fluorescent-labeled allele-specific probes in 192 SLE patients and 343 matched controls. Data were related to clinical features and treatment at the time of sampling and during the course of the disease. Results showed a significantly higher amount of serum TNFalpha in the entire SLE population compared with controls. However, TNFalpha serum levels correlated negatively with the use of antimalarial treatment during at least three months before sampling. Patients under single or combined treatment with these drugs had TNFalpha serum levels similar to healthy controls, whereas untreated patients and those under corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapies had increased amounts of this cytokine. This suggests, however, that antimalarial-mediated inhibition of TNFalpha was only significant in patients who were genetically high TNFalpha or low IL-10 producers. In addition, evaluation of SLE patients administered antimalarial drugs for three or more years who did not require any other specific SLE treatment indicates that patients with the combined genotype low IL-10/high TNFalpha are the best responders to antimalarial therapy, developing mild disease with a good course under this treatment. In conclusion, we proposed that an antimalarial-mediated downregulation of TNFalpha levels in SLE patients is influenced by polymorphisms at IL-10 and TNFalpha promoters. Our results may thus find important clinical application through the identification of patients who are the most likely to benefit from antimalarial therapy. ",0

To illustrate the role of medical castration in prostate cancer, this paper reviews data on the GnRH agonist triptorelin long-duration and shorter-duration formulations. A similar proportion of patients achieved and maintained castration levels of serum testosterone (?50 ng/dl) with all triptorelin formulations. Moreover, using a stricter definition of medical castration (serum testosterone <20 ng/dl), castration was maintained in >90% of patients with the 6-month triptorelin formulation. The new formulation was also well-tolerated, whilst being more convenient for patients. This short review assesses the role of this GnRH agonist in the treatment of prostate cancer.",1

Thirty-two peaks were separated and detected in J. curcas seed on a fused-core C(18) column between 2 and 25 min. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of the chromatographic data demonstrated that 12 batches of J. curcas seed could be well-differentiated and categorized into 5 groups. Especially, one sample obtained from Lijiang Yunan was significantly different from the others. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed that the metabolic profiling differentiation might be explained by 9 components including J.factors C(1)-C(5) of PEs, peak 21 (similar to J.factor C(1)) and 3 peaks (peaks 1, 9, and 10) significantly different in retention time from the PEs. The observation that the content levels of J.factors C(1) and C(2) plus peak 21 (equivalent to J.factor C(1)) were more relevant to the multivariate chromatographic data than the ones of J.factors C(3)-C(5) was confirmed by the PLS prediction models. The results of the present study indicated not only that J.factors C(1) and C(2) were the more rational markers representing the comprehensive quality of PEs in J. curcas seed but also that peak 21 (similar to J.factor C(1)) was a rational marker, too.

Acute Cd hepatotoxicity has been well studied in experimental animals; however, effects of prolonged exposure to Cd doses on the liver remain unclear. In the present study, to evaluate chronic Cd hepatotoxicity, we examined specimens from cases of itai-itai disease, the most severe form of chronic Cd poisoning. We compared 89 cases of itai-itai disease with 27 control cases to assess Cd concentration in organs. We also examined 80 cases of itai-itai disease and 70 control cases for histopathological evaluation. In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry for metallothionein, which binds and detoxifies Cd. Hepatic Cd concentration was higher than Cd concentration in all other organs measured in the itai-itai disease group, whereas it was second highest following renal concentration in the control group. In the liver in the itai-itai disease group, fibrosis was observed at a significantly higher rate than that in the control group. Metallothionein expression was significantly higher in the itai-itai disease group than that in the control group. Prolonged exposure to low doses of Cd leads to high hepatic accumulation, which can then cause fibrosis; however, it also causes high expression of metallothionein, which is thought to reduce Cd hepatotoxicity.""",1
11319,11319,17602085,Multicenter phase II study of fertility-sparing treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate for endometrial carcinoma and atypical hyperplasia in young women,"""PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of fertility-sparing treatment using medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for endometrial carcinoma (EC) and atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AH) in young women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter prospective study was carried out at 16 institutions in Japan. Twenty-eight patients having EC at presumed stage IA and 17 patients with AH at younger than 40 years of age were enrolled. All patients were given a daily oral dose of 600 mg of MPA with low-dose aspirin. This treatment continued for 26 weeks, as long as the patients responded. Histologic change of endometrial tissue was assessed at 8 and 16 weeks of treatment. Either estrogen-progestin therapy or fertility treatment was provided for the responders after MPA therapy. The primary end point was a pathologic complete response (CR) rate. Toxicity, pregnancy rate, and progression-free interval were secondary end points. RESULTS: CR was found in 55% of EC cases and 82% of AH cases. The overall CR rate was 67%. Neither therapeutic death nor irreversible toxicities were observed; however, two patients had grade 3 body weight gain, and one patient had grade 3 liver dysfunction. During the 3-year follow-up period, 12 pregnancies and seven normal deliveries were achieved after MPA therapy. Fourteen recurrences were found in 30 patients (47%) between 7 and 36 months. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of fertility-sparing treatment with a high-dose of MPA for EC and AH was proven by this prospective trial. Even in responders, however, close follow-up is required because of the substantial rate of recurrence.""",1

Report of 2 cases],Acute appendicitis can cause of portal vein thrombosis. Diagnosis of appendicitis can be difficult because its symptoms may be masked by those of acute portal vein thrombosis. We report 2 cases of appendicitis associated with acute portal vein thrombosis whose diagnosis was delayed by several months. The delayed diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the presence of acute portal vein thrombosis can be avoided by using spiral-computed tomography and careful investigation of signs of appendicitis. ,0
9360,9360,9347819,Fatal iron intoxication in an infant,"Iron ingestion continues to be one of the major contributors to pediatric poisoning deaths. In 1995, more than 22,000 children unintentionally received preparations containing iron. Despite child-resistant packaging and education of both the public and medical personnel, the number of deaths has not significantly declined. Our patient, a 13-month-old child, ingested prenatal vitamins and despite aggressive efforts died 13 hours after his initial presentation. The patient's 3-year-old sibling had been evaluated at a local hospital 12 hours earlier for iron ingestion. Although there have been previous reports of death from iron ingestion, this case report is important because of the sibling's presentation and medical evaluation 12 hours before our patient's presentation. This case illustrates the need for physicians to inquire about other children in the home, possibly preventing further tragic outcomes.",1

11196,11196,17215532,Inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein in familial hypercholesterolemia,"BACKGROUND: Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have markedly elevated cholesterol levels, which respond poorly to drug therapy, and a very high risk of premature cardiovascular disease. Inhibition of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein may be effective in reducing cholesterol levels in these patients. METHODS: We conducted a dose-escalation study to examine the safety, tolerability, and effects on lipid levels of BMS-201038, an inhibitor of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, in six patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. All lipid-lowering therapies were suspended 4 weeks before treatment. The patients received BMS-201038 at four different doses (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg per kilogram of body weight per day), each for 4 weeks, and returned for a final visit after a 4-week drug washout period. Analysis of lipid levels, safety laboratory analyses, and magnetic resonance imaging of the liver for fat content were performed throughout the study. RESULTS: All patients tolerated titration to the highest dose, 1.0 mg per kilogram per day. Treatment at this dose decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 50.9% and apolipoprotein B levels by 55.6% from baseline (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Kinetic studies showed a marked reduction in the production of apolipoprotein B. The most serious adverse events were elevation of liver aminotransferase levels and accumulation of hepatic fat, which at the highest dose ranged from less than 10% to more than 40%. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein by BMS-201038 resulted in the reduction of LDL cholesterol levels in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, owing to reduced production of apolipoprotein B. However, the therapy was associated with elevated liver aminotransferase levels and hepatic fat accumulation.",1

4071,4071,20018961,Genomewide association study of leprosy,"BACKGROUND: The narrow host range of Mycobacterium leprae and the fact that it is refractory to growth in culture has limited research on and the biologic understanding of leprosy. Host genetic factors are thought to influence susceptibility to infection as well as disease progression. METHODS: We performed a two-stage genomewide association study by genotyping 706 patients and 1225 controls using the Human610-Quad BeadChip (Illumina). We then tested three independent replication sets for an association between the presence of leprosy and 93 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were most strongly associated with the disease in the genomewide association study. Together, these replication sets comprised 3254 patients and 5955 controls. We also carried out tests of heterogeneity of the associations (or lack thereof) between these 93 SNPs and disease, stratified according to clinical subtype (multibacillary vs. paucibacillary). RESULTS: We observed a significant association (P<1.00x10(-10)) between SNPs in the genes CCDC122, C13orf31, NOD2, TNFSF15, HLA-DR, and RIPK2 and a trend toward an association (P=5.10x10(-5)) with a SNP in LRRK2. The associations between the SNPs in C13orf31, LRRK2, NOD2, and RIPK2 and multibacillary leprosy were stronger than the associations between these SNPs and paucibacillary leprosy. CONCLUSIONS: Variants of genes in the NOD2-mediated signaling pathway (which regulates the innate immune response) are associated with susceptibility to infection with M. leprae.",0

The personal observation of a case of simvastatin-induced acute cholestatic hepatitis prompted us to evaluate the true incidence of hepatic side effects of these drugs in a large Italian population. One hundred patients taking simvastatin and ninety patients treated with pravastatin were followed-up six months with periodical evaluation of serum lipid levels and liver function test. In 5% of simvastatin-treated patients and 4.5% of pravastatin-treated patients significant liver toxicity was observed, which required drug discontinuation. The mechanism of liver damage was direct, idiosyncratic, but immunological features of drug toxicity could be hypothesized in one patient.",1
12632,12632,22265699,Lithium toxicity profile: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"""BACKGROUND: Lithium is a widely used and effective treatment for mood disorders. There has been concern about its safety but no adequate synthesis of the evidence for adverse effects. We aimed to undertake a clinically informative, systematic toxicity profile of lithium. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies. We searched electronic databases, specialist journals, reference lists, textbooks, and conference abstracts. We used a hierarchy of evidence which considered randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and case reports that included patients with mood disorders given lithium. Outcome measures were renal, thyroid, and parathyroid function; weight change; skin disorders; hair disorders; and teratogenicity. FINDINGS: We screened 5988 abstracts for eligibility and included 385 studies in the analysis. On average, glomerular filtration rate was reduced by -6.22 mL/min (95% CI -14.65 to 2.20, p=0.148) and urinary concentrating ability by 15% of normal maximum (weighted mean difference -158.43 mOsm/kg, 95% CI -229.78 to -87.07, p<0.0001). Lithium might increase risk of renal failure, but the absolute risk was small (18 of 3369 [0.5%] patients received renal replacement therapy). The prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism was increased in patients taking lithium compared with those given placebo (odds ratio [OR] 5.78, 95% CI 2.00-16.67; p=0.001), and thyroid stimulating hormone was increased on average by 4.00 iU/mL (95% CI 3.90-4.10, p<0.0001). Lithium treatment was associated with increased blood calcium (+0.09 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.02-0.17, p=0.009), and parathyroid hormone (+7.32 pg/mL, 3.42-11.23, p<0.0001). Patients receiving lithium gained more weight than did those receiving placebo (OR 1.89, 1.27-2.82, p=0.002), but not those receiving olanzapine (0.32, 0.21-0.49, p<0.0001). We recorded no significant increased risk of congenital malformations, alopecia, or skin disorders. INTERPRETATION: Lithium is associated with increased risk of reduced urinary concentrating ability, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and weight gain. There is little evidence for a clinically significant reduction in renal function in most patients, and the risk of end-stage renal failure is low. The risk of congenital malformations is uncertain; the balance of risks should be considered before lithium is withdrawn during pregnancy. Because of the consistent finding of a high prevalence of hyperparathyroidism, calcium concentrations should be checked before and during treatment.

General epidemiology,"""As background to a study of the effectiveness of packaging in preventing childhood poisoning, the National Poisons Information Service coordinated a prospective survey, in which 9 Accident and Emergency (A & E) departments and 5 paediatric departments, between July 1982 and February 1984, recorded 2043 cases of suspected accidental poisoning in children aged 0-60 months. The products implicated were drugs (59%), household products (37%) and plants (3%). The drugs most frequently implicated were analgesics, anxiolytics, cough medicines, oral contraceptives and drugs to supplement diet or treat dietary disorders. The most frequently implicated household products were cleaners such as bleach, detergent and disinfectant, and petroleum distillate. Seventy-five per cent of the children were 2 and 3-year-olds. Fifty-six per cent were male. Only 22% of the children had signs or symptoms on admission. In only 2 cases were these serious. Treatment other than ipecacuanha and/or oral fluids was seldom required. Of the cases where outcome was recorded, 56% were discharged from A & E. The rest were admitted to a ward; only 7 children were admitted to intensive care units. No child died. Comparison with HASS and other epidemiological surveys shows that these results are representative of national trends.""",1
12627,12627,22251066,Rifaximin for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome,"INTRODUCTION: Few therapeutic options are available for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Lubiprostone is approved by the FDA for IBS with constipation, and alosetron in IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). It has been proposed that alterations in the bowel microflora may play a role in the pathophysiology of IBS, and that modulation of the microflora holds therapeutic potential. Rifaximin is a nonsystemic antibiotic that has shown efficacy in IBS. AREAS COVERED: This narrative review covers the treatment options available for IBS-D and focuses on rifaximin. Rifaximin pharmacodynamics, clinical pharmacology and results of clinical studies from proof of concept to the latest Phase III and retreatment studies in IBS are summarized. Challenges to rifaximin use, safety issues and regulatory data are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: The evidence supports rifaximin as an emerging treatment for IBS. Strategies for appropriate patient selection need to be further developed, and continued efficacy of rifaximin over repeated treatment courses needs to be better characterized.",1
12230,12230,20874042,"Everolimus: a proliferation signal inhibitor with clinical applications in organ transplantation, oncology, and cardiology","Everolimus, a proliferation signal inhibitor in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) drug class, has many clinical applications, including in organ transplantation, oncology, and cardiology. It currently has United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for prophylaxis against rejection in de novo renal transplant recipients, treatment of renal cell carcinoma, and use as a drug-eluting stent. To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of everolimus, we performed a search of the MEDLINE database (January 1997-April 2010) for all English-language articles of in vitro and in vivo studies that evaluated everolimus, as well as abstracts from recent scientific meetings and the manufacturer. In transplantation, everolimus demonstrates immunosuppressive properties and has been used to prevent acute rejection in cardiac, liver, lung, and renal transplant recipients. It appears that this agent may be potent enough to allow for the minimization or removal of calcineurin inhibitors in the long-term management of renal transplant recipients. In oncology, everolimus has been proven effective for the management of treatment-resistant renal cell carcinoma. In cardiology, everolimus is available as a drug-coated stent and is used in percutaneous coronary interventions for prevention of restenosis. In transplant recipients and patients with renal cell carcinoma, everolimus appears to have an extensive adverse-event profile. The pharmacologic properties of everolimus differentiate this agent from other drugs used in these clinical areas, and its pharmacokinetic properties differentiate it from sirolimus.",1
7993,7993,3596172,Cyclosporin A-induced cholestasis. The mechanism in a rat model,"Cyclosporin A (CyA) causes cholestasis in a significant proportion of transplant patients. Doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg CyA/kg body wt or the Miglyol 812 vehicle were administered intraperitoneally for 1, 2, and 3 wk to separate groups of rats to investigate the mechanism of this cholestasis. At 1 wk a dose-response relationship between serum CyA levels and increasing CyA doses was noted. A maximum CyA blood level was achieved by 2 wk with the 10- and 15-mg/kg doses. Subsequent studies were performed using the smaller (10 mg/kg) dose administered for 3 wk. This dose resulted in a marked increase in serum bile acid levels compared with vehicle-treated controls (24.6 +/- 4.0 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.2 mumol/L, p less than 0.001) without inducing significant changes in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin levels or hepatic architectural alterations. With CyA treatment, baseline bile flow decreased by 35% and bile salt secretion decreased by 25% compared with vehicle-treated animals. Cyclosporin A and vehicle-treated rats were infused intravenously with taurocholate (4 mumol/min X kg) for 2 h and then depleted of bile salts over the next 24 h. Bile samples collected over this period were graphed as bile salt secretion versus bile flow. The mean slope of the linear regression for the CyA-treated rats was 62% of the control, demonstrating a decrease in bile salt-dependent flow. Extrapolation of the linear regression to the ordinate demonstrated a 22% decrease in bile-independent flow with CyA treatment. Therefore, in our experimental model of CyA-induced cholestasis, the decrease in flow observed was the result of a decrease in both bile salt-dependent and bile salt-independent flows and occurred in the absence of significant biochemical or histologically evident hepatotoxicity.",1

This apparent protection does not extend to chronic or repeated high dose acetaminophen administration. The Illinois Poison Center (IPC) was consulted on a case involving a 7 month old 17 lb infant, who had presented the day prior to an emergency department with complaint of febrile illness. Patient had been prescribed acetaminophen for symptoms, and the mother called IPC when she realized that she had been incorrectly giving the patient concentrated infant acetaminophen (80 mg per 0.8 mL) totalling 42.3 mg/kg/dose or 234 mg/kg/24 hours instead of children's acetaminophen (160 mg/5 ml). Per recently published national triage guidelines, the patient was referred to an acute care facility for evaluation. The patient presented with significantly elevated aspartate aminotransferrase (AST) and alanine aminotransferrase (ALT) levels of 1339 and 907 U/L respectively, and was initiated on i.v. n-acetylcysteine therapy. The patient responded well to therapy, with AST and ALT declining to 145 and 479 U/L respectively over the next 48 hours.

The study is randomized and open label in three parallel groups. Primary efficacy variables are response rate and time to progression. WHO and ECOG criteria were used for measurable and nonmeasurable disease assessment, respectively. Safety was reported according to WHO criteria. Altogether 463 patients were randomized (157 to TOR60, 157 to TOR240, and 149 to TAM40). By data cut-off, after 20.5 months median follow-up time, over 70% of the patients had experienced disease progression. Response rates are 20.4%, 28.7%, and 20.8% in TOR60. TOR240, and TAM40, respectively. TOR60 and TAM40 show statistically equivalent efficacy and the difference between TOR240 and TAM40 is not significant (P = 0.112). Median times to progression are 4.9 (TOR60), 6.1 (TOR240), and 5.0 (TAM40) months and the corresponding hazard ratios (TAM:TOR) 1.015 and 1.124. Again, TOR60 and TAM40 are statistically equivalent and the difference between TOR240 and TAM40 is not significant (P = 0.374). All treatments were well tolerated. As a conclusion, TOR60 and TAM40 show equivalent clinical efficacy and tolerability. The higher dose of toremifene slightly but not statistically significantly improves response rate and time to progression. In postmenopausal women, toremifene 60 mg daily is an effective and safe treatment of advanced ER-positive or ER-unknown breast cancer.",1

There is concern that sirolimus may be associated with wound complications and hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). We have used sirolimus as primary immunosuppression in 170 liver transplant recipients and therefore reviewed our experience with wound complications and HAT in our cohort of patients. Records of all 170 patients administered sirolimus as primary immunosuppression and 180 historic controls were reviewed. Numbers of wound and hepatic artery complications were recorded, as well as the prevalence of obesity, reoperation, diabetes, and OKT3 use, all of which are risk factors for wound complications. The prevalence of wound complications was 12.4% in sirolimus-treated patients compared with 13.9% in historic controls (P = not significant [NS]). The prevalence of hepatic artery complications was 5.3% in sirolimus-treated patients compared with 8.3% in historic controls (P = NS). The prevalence of obesity and OKT3 administration was significantly lower in sirolimus-treated patients. Multivariate analysis failed to show an association between sirolimus therapy and hepatic artery or wound complications.

2213,2213,10377229,New (sulfonyloxy)piperazinyldibenzazepines as potential atypical antipsychotics: chemistry and pharmacological evaluation,"A series of 2- or 8-trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy (TfO) and 2- or 8-methylsulfonyloxy (MsO) 11-piperazinyldibenzodiazepines, -oxazepines, and -thiazepines were synthesized and evaluated in pharmacological models for their potential clozapine-like properties. In receptor binding assays, the 2-TfO analogues (18a, GMC2-83; 24, GMC3-06; and previously reported GMC1-169, 9a) of the dibenzazepines have profiles comparable to that of clozapine, acting on a variety of CNS receptors except they lack M1 receptor affinity. Introduction of 2-TfO to clozapine leads to compound 9e (GMC61-39) which has a similar binding profile as that of clozapine including having M1 receptor affinity. Interestingly, the MsO analogues, as well as the 8-TfO analogues, have no or weak dopaminergic and serotonergic affinities, but all 8-sulfonyloxy analogues do have M1 affinities. In behavioral studies performed to indicate the potential antipsychotic efficacy and the propensity to induce EPS, 2-TfO analogues blocked effectively the apomorphine-induced climbing in mice in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 values (mg/kg) of 2.1 sc for 9a, 1.3 po for 18a, 2.6 sc for 24, and 8.2 sc for 9e. On the other hand, they showed a clear dose separation with regard to their ED50 values (mg/kg) for indicating catalepsy in rats (>44 sc for 9a, 28 po for 18a, 30 sc for 24, and >50 sc for 9e, respectively), thus implicating a more favorable therapeutic ratio (K/A, ED50 climbing/ED50 catalepsy) in comparison with typical neuroleptics such as haloperidol and isoclozapine. Furthermore, compound 18a was also demonstrated to be an orally potent DA antagonist with an ED50 value of 0.7 mg/kg po in the ex vivo L-DOPA accumulation model. The present study contributes to the SAR of 11-piperazinyldibenzazepines, and the 2-TfO analogues of 11-piperazinyldibenzazepines are promising candidates as clozapine-like atypical antipsychotics with low propensity to induce EPS.

7716,7716,2593049,Animal model of margosa oil ingestion with Reye-like syndrome. Pathogenesis of microvesicular fatty liver,"The aetiology and pathogenesis of Reye's syndrome (RS) are incompletely understood. A number of environmental toxins and biological agents, including viruses, have been postulated to cause RS, either acting alone or synergistically. Most investigations have suggested that the primary insult is in the liver mitochondria, leading to a complex biochemical catastrophe, with death from encephalopathy. Margosa oil (MO), a long-chain fatty acid compound, has been shown to cause a Reye-like syndrome with death from hepatoencephalopathy, in children in Malaysia and India. The present time-course study performed in MO-administered mice showed the development of hepatic lesions with many features of RS. MO acts rapidly, within 30 min, on the nuclei of hepatocytes inducing mitoses and binucleated cells. This is followed by mitochondrial injury, with swelling, rarefaction of matrix, loss of dense bodies, pleomorphism, and loss of ribosomes starting at 60 min. There is loss of liver glycogen, and proliferation and hypertrophy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), followed by the presence of lipid droplets in the hyaloplasm, and globules within dilated cisterns of the ER. Additional fatty acids from lipolysis of body adipocytes, and fat globules from intestinal MO ingestion further aggravate the liver fatty change. There is evidence of fat globule ingestion by endocytosis into hepatocytes at the level of the sinusoids. The development of microvesicular liver steatosis and glycogen depletion due to involvement of liver cell organelles occur rapidly as in RS.",1

In controls and patients with IPF, the ratio of helper to suppressor T cells was 1.8:1 in lungs and blood. In contrast, this ratio was 10.5:1 in lungs (P less than 0.001) and 0.8:1 in blood (P less than 0.05) in patients with sarcoidosis and high-intensity alveolitis. The ratio of helper to suppressor T cells was not higher in the lungs or blood of patients with sarcoidosis and low-intensity alveolitis; on the contrary, because of the higher proportions of suppressor cells, the ratio of helper to suppressor cells was lower in both lungs and blood. In studies of function, lung T cells from patients with sarcoidosis and high-intensity alveolitis released monocyte chemotactic factor (a lymphokine critical to granuloma formation) and polyclonally activated B cells to produce immunoglobulins. We conclude that one determinant of lung injury in sarcoidosis in the presence of large numbers of lung helper T cells, which are important in granuloma formation.",0

6197,6197,28942404,Successful treatment using rituximab in a patient with refractory polymyositis complicated by scleroderma renal crisis,"Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for patients with inflammatory myopathies. Myositis can be a clinical feature of scleroderma (polymyositis-scleroderma overlap syndrome), and treatment of this syndrome is a challenge for clinicians because moderate to high doses of corticosteroids are considered a risk factor for development of acute kidney injury in affected patients. We report here the case of a 56-year-old woman with scleroderma who developed polymyositis and was successfully treated with rituximab. Initial treatment of the polymyositis with prednisolone 40 mg/day was rapidly tapered to 2.5 mg/day due to development of scleroderma renal crisis, for which four weekly infusions of rituximab (500 mg; off-label) were given. She responded well to rituximab in addition to prednisolone 2.5 mg/day. Rituximab may improve inflammatory myopathies, even in cases where high-dose corticosteroids should be avoided due to complications. Rituximab should be considered as a treatment option in cases of refractory polymyositis. ",0
360,360,1524655,Interindividual variabilities in haloperidol interconversion and the reduced haloperidol/haloperidol ratio,"Metabolism of haloperidol in humans includes N-dealkylation to inactive metabolites and reduction to reduced haloperidol; reduced haloperidol is also oxidized back to haloperidol. A single 0.5 mg/kg (0.00133 mmol/kg) oral dose of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol was administered to seven Chinese schizophrenics in a randomized crossover manner separated by a 2-week interval. The clearance values for the different metabolic pathways of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol were determined. There were differences up to 10-fold in both oxidation and reduction capacities. There were also interindividual variabilities in the elimination of reduced haloperidol (0.37 +/- 0.20 L/hr/kg) and the N-dealkylation pathway (0.74 +/- 0.36 L/hr/kg). Four weeks after the single-dose study, the same patients also received haloperidol (10 mg) twice daily for 4 weeks. The reduced haloperidol to haloperidol concentration ratio (0.40 +/- 0.16) after the 4-week therapy is related to individual variabilities in the interconversion process and the N-dealkylation pathway of haloperidol.

7183,7183,547161,Hepatic toxicity of adjuvant chemotherapy for carcinoma of the breast,"Four patients developed abnormal liver function tests and focal defects on liver scan while receiving cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil as adjuvant chemotherapy following mastectomy for breast cancer. Liver biopsies showed severe focal inflammation. The biopsy findings and the subsequent clinical course of the patients strongly suggest that these abnormalities were due to hepatic toxicity of the chemotherapy and not metastic breast cancer. A review of serial liver function tests performed on 24 patients in that chemotherapy program revealed that four out of eight patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase prior to therapy developed early metastatic cancer. Elevated alkaline phosphatase occurring during chemotherapy on the other hand was quite common but more likely due to hepatic toxicity of the drugs. The development of abnormal liver function tests even in association with focal defects on liver scan is not sufficient to diagnose metastatic breast cancer in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.",1
6393,6393,29194682,Impact of hepatitis C virus polymorphisms on direct-acting antiviral treatment efficacy: Regulatory analyses and perspectives,"Several highly effective, interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based regimens are available for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Despite impressive efficacy overall, a small proportion of patients in registrational trials experienced treatment failure, which in some cases was associated with the detection of HCV resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) at baseline. In this article, we describe methods and key findings from independent regulatory analyses investigating the impact of baseline nonstructural (NS) 3 Q80K and NS5A RASs on the efficacy of current United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved regimens for patients with HCV genotype (GT) 1 or GT3 infection. These analyses focused on clinical trials that included patients who were previously na?ve to the DAA class(es) in their investigational regimen and characterized the impact of baseline RASs that were enriched in the viral population as natural or transmitted polymorphisms (i.e., not drug-selected RASs). We used a consistent approach to optimize comparability of results across different DAA regimens and patient populations, including the use of a 15% sensitivity cutoff for next-generation sequencing results and standardized lists of NS5A RASs. These analyses confirmed that detection of NS3 Q80K or NS5A baseline RASs was associated with reduced treatment efficacy for multiple DAA regimens, but their impact was often minimized with the use of an intensified treatment regimen, such as a longer treatment duration and/or addition of ribavirin. We discuss the drug resistance-related considerations that contributed to pretreatment resistance testing and treatment recommendations in drug labeling for FDA-approved DAA regimens. CONCLUSION: Independent regulatory analyses confirmed that baseline HCV RASs can reduce the efficacy of certain DAA-based regimens in selected patient groups. However, highly effective treatment options are available for patients with or without baseline RASs. (Hepatology 2018;67:2430-2448).",0
9673,9673,10656221,Gliclazide-induced acute hepatitis,"There are few reports in the literature related to sulfonylurea-induced hepatotoxicity. We describe the case of acute hepatitis induced by gliclazide, a second generation sulfonylurea. A 60-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus (type 2) developed an acute icteric hepatitis-like illness 6 weeks after the initiation of gliclazide therapy. Other causes of acute hepatocellular necrosis were excluded. Liver histology showed marked portal inflammation with lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils, associated with lobular inflammation (indicative of a histological pattern consistent with drug-induced hepatitis). The drug was immediately withdrawn and the patient was given glibenclamide. The patient recovered clinically and, in less than 4 weeks, her serum bilirubin and aminotransferases returned to normal levels. We believe that this is the first description of acute hepatitis caused by an idiosyncratic adverse reaction to gliclazide or to one of its metabolites. In conclusion, this case strongly suggests that gliclazide can induce acute icteric liver necro-inflammation which may be misdiagnosed clinically as acute viral hepatitis. In patients who show abnormal liver function tests, the immediate discontinuation of gliclazide is recommended.",1
7197,7197,602767,Liver ultrastructure in psoriatics related to methotrexate therapy. 2. Findings in bile ducts from 11 methotrexate treated psoriatics and 2 controls,To determinate what damage occurred in the bile ducts of psoriatics receiving Methotrexate (MTX) therapy liver biopsies from 11 patients were studied with the light and electron microscope and compared with normal material. Thick sections (1 micrometer) showed light and dark cells in biliary epithelium and lipofuscin granules. At the ultrastructural level these were confirmed. The lumen of the bile ducts contained debris. The microvilli were decreased in number and damaged forms appeared. Damage to the biliary epithelial mitochondria was widespread and there were foci of intracellular oedema. The Golgi apparatus was hypertrophied and dilated. Atrophic cells were seen. The lateral intercellular spaces were dilated and contained debris and the basement membrane showed zones of duplication. Similar changes were found in the ducts of Hering.,1
6543,6543,29889371,CHRONIC PANCREATITIS AS A PREDICTOR OF OSTEOPOROSIS FORMATION,"The issues of formation of secondary osteoporosis in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) were discussed in this paper. It was shown that the chronic relapsing nature of the disease process in the pancreas leads to hypokalemia due to malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D as the result of maldigestion. As well as the redistribution of ionized and total calcium blood between the body fluids, which can be a consequence of long-term nature of pain. At the same time, the study of the content of enzymes bone found their decline to a greater extent characteristic index tartrate resistant acid fosfatazy-marker of bone resorption. Changes in bone metabolism were confirmed by ultrasound bone (densitometry) at which proved the development of osteoporosis in 47,7% of cases, and osteopenia in 35,7% of patients. The conclusions about the need for pre-clinical diagnosis of osteoporotic states in patients with CP, correction of diet and administration of appropriate therapy were made. ",0
11048,11048,16710026,Randomized comparison of every-2-week darbepoetin alfa and weekly epoetin alfa for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia: the 20030125 Study Group Trial,"""PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced anemia is widely treated in the United States with darbepoetin alfa (DA) or epoetin alfa (EA). This noninferiority study systematically compares efficacy and safety of DA and EA using common doses and schedules used in clinical practice. METHODS: Patients had a diagnosis of nonmyeloid malignancy with > or = 8 weeks of planned chemotherapy, age >or = 18 years, and anemia (hemoglobin < or = 11 g/dL). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to DA 200 microg every two weeks (Q2W) or EA 40,000 units every week (QW) for up to 16 weeks with identical dose adjustment rules. Efficacy was assessed by the incidence of RBC transfusion (Kaplan-Meier estimate). The definition of noninferiority was that the upper 95% CI limit of the observed difference in RBC transfusions between groups was less than 11.5%; this noninferiority margin was based on the treatment effect observed in placebo-controlled EA studies. RESULTS: Of 1,220 patients randomly assigned, 1,209 received > or = one dose of the study drug. Common tumor types were lung (26%), breast (21%), and gastrointestinal (18%). Transfusion incidence from week 5 to the end of the treatment phase (the primary end point) was 21% in the DA group and 16% in the EA group; noninferiority was concluded because the upper 95% CI limit of the difference between groups (10.8%) was below the prespecified noninferiority margin. Sensitivity analyses using alternate statistical methods and analysis sets yielded similar results. Hemoglobin, quality of life, and safety end points further support equivalency of the erythropoietic therapies. CONCLUSION: This large, phase III study demonstrates comparable efficacy of DA Q2W and EA QW. Less frequent dosing offers potential benefits for patients, caregivers and health care providers.""",1
7595,7595,2125388,Vascular hepatotoxicity related to heroin addiction,"""The hepatotoxic effect of heroin has been demonstrated in liver biopsies by morphometric analysis of four groups of patients: twenty-one drug abusers (DA) at the time of the biopsy, eighteen patients who had stopped drug consumption for at least six months (ex-DA), twelve patients with post-transfusional chronic active hepatitis (PTCAH), and eleven controls (CONTROL). Semiquantitative assessment showed the extent of sinusoidal dilatation and the inflammatory and fibrotic reaction in the terminal hepatic vein (THV). Thickening and cellularity of the venular wall and the volume density of sinusoidal lumen (Vsl) in the Zone I and III of the hepatic acinus, were also evaluated. The morphometric analysis used computerized measurements. In DA, the sinusoidal dilatation (100% of cases), the sinusoidal and THV inflammation (81% and 67.7%, respectively), localized mainly in the centrilobular zone, were more pronounced than in ex-DA, in patients with PTCAH and in CONTROL (significantly different P less than 0.0001). Conversely, the fibrotic reaction (perisinusoidal fibrosis--44.4% and perivenular fibrosis--61.1%) was more frequent in ex-DA. The THV inflammation in DA was replaced by a fibrotic matrix deposit in the THV wall (wall surface/internal surface = 2.72 +/- 0.37 in ex-DA; 1.38 +/- 0.32 in DA; 0.87 +/- 0.14 in PTCAH and 0.45 +/- 0.03 in CONTROL--significantly different P less than 0.001), associated with a perisinusoidal fibrosis, after drug withdrawal. Moreover, there was significantly decreased venular wall cellularity in ex-DA (wall surface/mesenchymal cells = 949 +/- 158 in ex-DA; 622 +/- 40 in DA; 619 +/- 61 in PTCAH; 547 +/- 23 in CONTROL--P less than 0.001). Semiquantitative and morphometric data suggest that these vascular lesions and their reversibility may be due to the direct hepatotoxic effects of heroin.""",1
13357,13357,24400777,"Discovery of ABT-267, a pan-genotypic inhibitor of HCV NS5A","We describe here N-phenylpyrrolidine-based inhibitors of HCV NS5A with excellent potency, metabolic stability, and pharmacokinetics. Compounds with 2S,5S stereochemistry at the pyrrolidine ring provided improved genotype 1 (GT1) potency compared to the 2R,5R analogues. Furthermore, the attachment of substituents at the 4-position of the central N-phenyl group resulted in compounds with improved potency. Substitution with tert-butyl, as in compound 38 (ABT-267), provided compounds with low-picomolar EC50 values and superior pharmacokinetics. It was discovered that compound 38 was a pan-genotypic HCV inhibitor, with an EC50 range of 1.7-19.3 pM against GT1a, -1b, -2a, -2b, -3a, -4a, and -5a and 366 pM against GT6a. Compound 38 decreased HCV RNA up to 3.10 log10 IU/mL during 3-day monotherapy in treatment-naive HCV GT1-infected subjects and is currently in phase 3 clinical trials in combination with an NS3 protease inhibitor with ritonavir (r) (ABT-450/r) and an NS5B non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor (ABT-333), with and without ribavirin.",1
7894,7894,3154674,The pharmacology of nisoldipine,"Nisoldipine is a calcium antagonist that specifically blocks the slow or voltage-dependent calcium channel up to the highest concentrations. This mode of action has been confirmed in pharmacological studies on isolated organs, electrophysiological and binding studies, and by the measurement of transmembrane calcium transport. As with other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, an interaction with intracellular calcium reservoirs and calmodulin seems to be of minor importance. The drug exhibits higher potency, longer duration of action, and a higher binding affinity in vitro and in vivo than nifedipine. In contrast to its vasodilating and spasmolytic activity, its negative inotropic effect occurs in vitro only after higher concentrations than after nifedipine. In whole animals a secondary positive inotropic effect occurs regularly owing to sympathetic counter-regulation. The influence of nisoldipine on cardiac stimulus formation and conduction is also very slight in anesthetized animals, and is completely eliminated in awake animals and humans by counter-regulation up to very high doses. The cardiac anti-ischemic action of nisoldipine has been demonstrated in various ischemia models and is probably based predominantly on its afterload-reducing properties in addition to its spasmolytic effect on the coronary arteries. Various other suspected effects, for which there are isolated indications, e.g., inhibition of thromboxane synthesis, preload reduction, interaction with the transport of adenosine, and normalization of the sarcolemmal Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity, are probably of subordinate importance. Its antihypertensive effect is explained primarily by lowering of the peripheral resistance. There are, however, some indications that nisoldipine exerts certain effects over and above pure vasodilation. The prevention of postischemic calcium overloading in the renal tubule epithelium and the natriuretic effect are probably of importance in the therapeutic action. Clinically, nisoldipine was found more potent and prolonged in its action in comparison with nifedipine. In comparative studies, nisoldipine, 10 mg once a day, was found equieffective with nifedipine 10 mg three times or 20 mg twice a day in angina or hypertension, respectively.",1

663,663,2168516,Secondary biosynthetic defects in women with late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Late-onset (non-classic) congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a cause of hirsutism, menstrual disorders, and infertility, but its frequency and the patterns of abnormalities in adrenal hormone secretion are not well understood. We investigated the frequency and ethnic distribution of nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to deficiencies of 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-steroid dehydrogenase, 21-hydroxylase, or 11 beta-hydroxylase among 170 Israeli Jewish women with these clinical problems. All enzyme defects were identified by comparing the patients' hormonal responses to a 0.25-mg intravenous bolus dose of alpha 1-24-ACTH with those of 26 age-matched normal women. RESULTS: Twenty women (12 percent) had 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-steroid dehydrogenase deficiency, 18 (10 percent) 21-hydroxylase deficiency (14 homozygous), and 14 (8 percent) 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency. All the homozygous women with 21-hydroxylase deficiency also had evidence of a partial deficiency in 11 beta-hydroxylase activity. Similarly, most of the women with 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency also had evidence of a deficiency in 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-steroid dehydrogenase. Among the 118 women with no adrenal biosynthetic defect, 38 had high plasma androgen concentrations, and 80 had normal concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: About one third of Israeli Jewish women with hirsutism, menstrual disorders, or unexplained infertility had nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Secondary adrenal biosynthetic defects were frequent in these women and were probably caused by intra-adrenal androgen excess rather than by dual inherited enzymatic deficiencies.",0

13103,13103,23594140,Chloral hydrate versus hydroxyzine HCL for sedation prior to pediatric sleep EEG recording,"OBJECTIVE: The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) can reveal certain epileptiform activity patterns and facilitate localization of the focus. Sedation is often required for sleep EEG recording in pediatric patients, but there is no consensus on the optimal sedative. Hydroxyzine HCL (HH) and chloral hydrate (CH) are popular sedatives, but HH is rarely used for pediatric sleep EEG recording. The goal of this prospective study was to compare CH to HH for sleep induction efficacy, safety and effects on pediatric sleep EEG pattern. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 282 children (age 4-9 years) referred to our sleep EEG laboratory and requiring sedation were randomly assigned to two groups: the CH Group (n = 141) received 50 mg/kg CH and the HH group (n = 141) received 1 mg/kg HH. If sedation was unsatisfactory, a second equal dose of the same sedative was administered 30 min later. RESULTS: Sleep induction was less successful in the HH group compared to the CH group (p < 0.001). Sleep onset latency was significantly longer in the HH group (p < 0.01) and the proportion of HH group patients requiring a second sedative dose significantly higher (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients exhibiting epileptiform activity on the EEG or in adverse event rate between groups. CONCLUSION: CH was a superior sedative compared to HH owing to more rapid and successful sleep induction with no increase in adverse events.",1
